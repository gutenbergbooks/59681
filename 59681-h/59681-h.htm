    “MR. DOUGLASS wants to see you, Master Harry,” said the maid, coming
    to the door of the boys’ room.
  </p>

  <p>
    “What’s he found out now, I wonder?” said Harry to Philip, in a low
    tone. “I don’t remember anything I have done lately.”
  </p>

  <p>“He’s in a hurry, too,” said the girl, closing the door.</p>

  <p>
    Harry ran down to Mr. Douglass’s room on the first floor. The two
    boys were beginning their preparation for college, and were living in
    a suburb of New York city with their tutor, Mr. Douglass, a college
    graduate, and a man of about thirty-five. Harry’s father, Mr. Blake,
    was abroad on railroad business, and did not expect to return for
    some months. Philip was Harry’s cousin, but the two boys were very
    unlike in disposition—as will be seen. Their bringing up may have
    been responsible for some of the differences in traits and character,
    for Harry was a city boy, while his cousin was country-bred.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Harry knocked at the door of Mr. Douglass’s study, he knew by
    the tutor’s tone in inviting him in that the teacher had not called
    him simply for a trivial reprimand. It was certainly something
    serious; perhaps news from Harry’s father and mother.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Sit down, Harry,” said the tutor,—“and don’t be worried,” he added,
    seeing how solemn the boy looked. “I have had a message by cable from
    your father; but it’s good news, not bad. Read it.”
  </p>

  <p>He handed Harry the despatch. It read:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Take Hal and Phil to Fair. My expense. Letter to Chicago. See Farwell
      about money and tickets.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>“Rather sudden, isn’t it?” said Mr. Douglass, smiling.</p>

    <div class="captionr">THE FOUNDATION OF THE MANUFACTURES</div>
  </div>

  <p>“Yes,” said Harry, “but—immense! Don’t you think so?”</p>

  <p>
    “I’m glad to go,” the tutor said. “It seems to me that a visit to the
    Fair is worth more than all the studying here you boys could do in
    twice the time you’ll spend there; and it’s a lucky opportunity for
    me.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Then you’ll go?” said Harry, to whom the news seemed a bit of fairy
    story come true, with the Atlantic cable for a magic wand.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Of course,” answered the tutor. “The only thing that surprises me is
    the quickness of your father’s decision.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “That’s just like him,” said Harry. “He’s a railroad man, you know,
    and they always go at high pressure. Why, he’d rather talk by
    telephone, even when he can’t get anything but a buzz and a squeak on
    the wire, than send a messenger who’d get there in half the time.”
  </p>

  <p>“But has he said anything about sending you before?”</p>

  <p>
    “No. The fact is, people abroad are slow to know what a whacker this
    Fair is! They think it’s a mere foreign exposition. Father’s just
    found out that Uncle Sam has covered himself with glory, and now
    he wants Phil and me to see the bird from beak to claws—the whole
    American Eagle.”
  </p>

  <p>“But sha’n’t we have trouble about tickets?” asked Mr. Douglass.</p>

  <p>
    “No,” said Harry. “Father’s a railroad man. That’s what ‘See Farwell’
    means. You let me go to see him. He’s the general manager, or some
    high-cockalorum. He’ll see us through by daylight.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Very well,” said Mr. Douglass, “I’m just as glad to go as you are.
    Philip and I will attend to the packing, and you shall go to New York
    this afternoon and see Mr. Farwell. Now you can tell Philip about
    it.”
  </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    Harry ran out of the room, slamming the door behind him, but Mr.
    Douglass only laughed. Perhaps he would have slammed it, too, if he’d
    been in the boy’s place.
  </p>

  <p>“Well?” said Philip, looking up from the Xenophon he was translating.</p>

  <p>“Thanks be to Christopher Columbus!” said Harry, with a jig-step.</p>

  <p>“Has he done anything new?” Philip asked, looking over his spectacles.</p>

  <p>“I guess not,” said Harry, “but we’re going to the Fair.”</p>

  <p>“How can we?” Philip asked.</p>

  <p>
    Harry threw the cable despatch down upon the table, and turned to get
    his hat. Philip read the telegram, carefully wiped his glasses, rose,
    put the Xenophon into its place upon his book-shelves, and said:
  </p>

  <p>“Xenophon will have to attend to his own parasangs for a while.”</p>

  <p>
    “You pack up for me, and I’ll see to the railroad-tickets,” said
    Harry. “I have just about time to catch the train for New York.”
  </p>

  <p>
    That was a hard and busy day for all three of the party. Perhaps
    Harry’s share was the easiest, for, by showing his father’s despatch
    to Mr. Farwell, he had everything made easy for him. Still, even
    influence might not have secured them places except for the aid of
    chance. It happened that a prominent man had, at the last moment, to
    give up a section in the Wagner sleeper, and this was turned over
    to Harry. So, late in the afternoon the boy came back with what he
    called “three gilt-edged accordion-pleated tickets.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile Mr. Douglass and Philip had put into three traveling-bags
    as much as six would hold, and the party went to bed early to get a
    good rest before the long journey.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">4</span></p>

    <div class="caption">A WILDERNESS OF IRON.—BUILDING MACHINERY HALL.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Next day at nearly half-past four the three travelers walked through
    the passageway at the Grand Central Depot, had their tickets
    punched,—and Philip noticed that the man at the gate kept tally on
    a printed list of the numbers of different tickets presented,—and
    entered the mahogany and blue-plush Wagner cars.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a few minutes some one said quietly: “All right,” and the train
    gently moved out.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I can remember,” said Mr. Douglass, “when a train started with a
    shock<span class="pagenum">5</span> like a Japanese earthquake. Now this seemed to glide out as if
    saying, ‘Oh, by the way, I think I’ll go to Chicago!’”
  </p>

  <p>
    Harry laughed. “Yes,” he said, “and how little fuss there is about
    it. Why, abroad, I remember that they had first a bell, then a yell,
    then a scream, then the steam!”
  </p>

  <p>
    As the train passed through the long tunnel just after leaving the
    station, Mr. Douglass remarked:
  </p>

  <p>“How monotonous those dark arches of brickwork are!”</p>

  <p>“Yes,” said Philip, “they should have a set of frescos put in them.”</p>

  <p>
    “But no one could see the pictures,” said Mr. Douglass, “we pass them
    so fast.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “That’s true,” said Harry, with a pretended sigh; “but they might
    have to be instantaneous photographs.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Philip looked puzzled for a minute and then laughed. After they left
    the tunnel, they passed through the suburbs of New York, entered a
    narrow cut that turned westward, and were soon sailing along the
    Hudson River—or so it seemed. There was no shore visible beside them,
    except for an occasional tumble-down dock, and beyond lay the river—a
    soft, gray expanse relieved against the Palisades, and later against
    more distant purple hills. It was a rest for their eyes to see only
    an occasional sloop breaking the long stretch of water, and the noise
    of the train was lessened because there was nothing to echo back the
    sounds from the river.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mr. Douglass found his pleasure in the scenery, the widenings of the
    river, the soft outlines of the hills, the long reflection of the
    setting sun. But the boys cared more to see the passengers.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Isn’t it funny,” said Philip, “how Americans take things as a matter
    of course? I really believe that if the train was a sort of Jules
    Verne unlimited express for the planet Mars, the people would all
    look placid and read the evening papers.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Of course,” said Harry. “What else can they do? Would you expect me
    to go forward and say: ‘Dear Mr. Engineer, but <em>do</em> you really think
    you know what all these brass and steel things are? Don’t you feel
    scared? Won’t you lie down awhile on the coal, while I run the engine
    for you?’”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Nonsense!” said Philip, laughing. “But they might show some
    interest.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “They do,” said Harry; “but that’s not what I’m thinking of. I’m
    thinking I’ll be a civil engineer.”
  </p>

  <p>“Why?” said Philip.</p>

  <p>
    “Just think,” Harry answered, pointing from the car window, “what a<span class="pagenum">6</span>
    good time they must have had laying out this road! Why, it was just a
    camping-out frolic, that’s all it was.”
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <div class="caption">ONE OF THE DECORATORS AT WORK.</div>
  </div>

  <p>“Didn’t you hear the waiter say dinner was ready?” said Mr. Douglass.</p>

  <p>
    “No,” said Philip; “but I knew it ought to be, if they care for the
    feelings of their passengers. Where is the dining-car?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “At the end of the train,” said Mr. Douglass. “Come, we’ll walk
    through.”
  </p>

  <p>
    So, in single file (“like cannibals on the trail of a missionary,”
    Harry said), they passed from car to car. The cars were connected by
    vestibules—collapsible <span class="pagenum">7</span> passageways, folding like an accordion—and
    it was not necessary to go outside at all. The train was an unbroken
    hallway.
  </p>

  <p>
    “It is much like a long, narrow New York flat,” said Philip. “People
    who live in flats must feel perfectly at home when they travel in
    these cars.”
  </p>

  <p>
    They found the dining-car very pretty and comfortable. Along one
    side were tables where two could sit, face to face. On the opposite
    side of the aisle the tables accommodated four. The boys and their
    tutor took one of the larger tables. The bill of fare was that of a
    well-appointed hotel or restaurant,—soup, fish, entrées, joint, and
    dessert,—and it was difficult to realize that they were eating while
    covering many miles an hour; in fact, the only circumstance that was
    a reminder of the journeying was a slight rim around the edge of the
    table to keep the dishes from traveling too.

    <div class="caption">MAKING “STAFF.”</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    “It is strange,” said Mr. Douglass, “how people have learned to
    eat dishes in a certain order, such as you see on a bill of fare.
    Probably this order of eating is the result of tens of millions of
    experiments, and therefore the best way.”

  <p><span class="pagenum">9</span></p>

  <p>“The best for us,” said Philip; “but how about the Chinese?”</p>

  <p>Mr. Douglass had to confess himself the objection well taken.</p>

  <p>
    “I believe the Chinese were created to be the exceptions to all
    rules,” he said.
  </p>

  <p>
    The dining-car had an easy, swaying motion that was very pleasant,
    and altogether the dinner was a most welcome change from the ordinary
    routine of a railway journey.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the boys walked back to their own section, Philip noticed a little
    clock set into the woodwork at one end of the smoking-car. He was
    surprised to see that it had two hour-hands, one red and one black.
  </p>

  <p>
    He pointed it out to Mr. Douglass, who told him that the clock
    indicated both New York and Chicago times—which differ by an hour,
    one following what is called “Eastern,” the other “Central” time.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the time they were again settled in their places it was dark
    outside; and, as Philip poetically said, they seemed to be “boring a
    hole through a big dark.” One of the colored porters looked curiously
    at Philip, as if he had overheard this remark without understanding
    its poetical bearing.
  </p>

  <p>“He thinks you are a Western desperado!” said Harry, with a grin.</p>

  <p>
    “Boys,” said Mr. Douglass, “the porters will soon make up the beds,
    and I want you to see how ingeniously everything is arranged.”
  </p>

  <p>Here is what the porter did:</p>

  <p>
    He stood straddling on two seats, turned a handle in the top of a
    panel, and pulled down the upper berth. It moved on hinges, and was
    supported after the manner of a book-shelf by two chains that ran on
    spring pulleys.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then he fastened two strong wire ropes from the upper to the lower
    berths.
  </p>

  <p>“What’s that for?” asked Harry.</p>

  <p>
    “To prevent passengers from being smashed flat by the shutting up
    of the berth,” Philip answered, after a moment’s puzzling over the
    question.
  </p>

  <p>
    “You can have the upper berth, Philip,” said Harry, impressively.
    “It’s better ventilated than the lower, they say; but I don’t mind
    that.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile the porter took from the upper berth two pieces of
    mahogany, cut to almost fill the space between the tops of the seats
    and the side roofs of the car. The edges were grooved, and slid along
    upon and closely fitted the top of the seat and a molding on the
    roof. These side-pieces were next fastened by a brass bolt pushed up
    from the end of the seat-back.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then the bed-clothing (kept by day in the lower seats and behind the
    upper panel) was spread on the upper berth, and the mattress of the
    lower berth was made up from the seat-cushions, supported upon short
    slats set from seat to seat.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">10</span></p>

  <p>
    While the beds were being made, the boys were amused to see some
    ladies laughing at the man’s method of getting the clothes and
    pillows into place. A woman seems to coax the bed into shape, but a
    man bullies it into submission.
  </p>

  <p>
    “They think it’s funny to see him make a bed,” said Harry, in an
    undertone; “but if they were to try to throw a stone, or bait a
    fish-hook, I guess the darky would have a right to smile some too.”
  </p>

  <p>
    To finish his work, the porter hung a thick pair of curtains on hooks
    along a horizontal pole, and then affixed a long plush strip to which
    were fastened large gilt figures four inches high—the number of the
    section.
  </p>

  <p>
    “It would be fun to change the numbers around,” remarked Harry,
    pensively. “Then nobody would know who he was when he got up. But
    perhaps it would make a boy unpopular if he was caught at it.”
  </p>

  <div class="figleft">
    <a id="i_023"><img src="images/i_023.jpg" width="150" height="212" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">“YO’ SECTION<br />READY, SAH!”</div>
  </div>

  <p>Mr. Douglass admitted that it might.</p>

  <p>
    As the porter made up their own section, Harry pulled out his
    sketch-book and made a little picture of him.
  </p>

  <p>
    “It’s hard times on the railroad now,” he remarked, as he finished
    the sketch. “See how short they have to make the porters’ jackets!
    But it must save starch!”
  </p>

  <p>
    The boys had wondered how the people would get to bed, but there
    seemed no difficulty about it. As for our boys, who had the upper
    berth, one by one they took off their shoes, coats and vests, etc.,
    and then climbed behind the curtains, where they put their pajamas
    over their underclothes.
  </p>

  <p>After they were in bed, they talked but little, for they were tired.</p>

  <p>“This rocking makes me drowsy,” Philip said; “it’s like a cradle.”</p>

  <p>
    “Yes,” Harry answered, as the car lurched a little—“a cradle rocked
    by a mother with the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Vitus’s dance!”
  </p>

  <p>
    While going to sleep, the boys were puzzled to account for the
    strange noises made by the train. At times it seemed to have run over
    a china-shop, and at other times the train rumbled hoarsely, as if it
    were running over the top of an enormous bass-drum.
  </p>

  <p>
    Soon the great train was transporting two boys who were fast asleep
    in Section No. 12; they woke fitfully during the night, but only
    vaguely remembered where they were, until the cold light of morning
    was reflected from the top of the car.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">11</span></p>

  <p>
    Dressing was more difficult than going to bed, but by a combination
    of patience and gymnastics Harry and Philip were soon able to take
    places in the line that led to the wash-room. Thence, later, they
    came forth ready for breakfast (for which they had to “line up”
    again), and another all-day ride.

  <p>
    At breakfast, the next table to them was occupied by a gentleman
    named Phinney, and his son. Harry knew the son slightly, having once
    been his schoolmate. Young Phinney was making a second visit to the
    Fair, and he told Harry that on the former trip the train had run
    around Niagara Falls in such a way as to give the passengers an
    opportunity to view them.

  <p><span class="pagenum">13</span></p>

  <p>
    The train had stopped there for five minutes, and they had climbed
    down near the rapids to a point where there was an excellent view of
    “the great cataract”—so young Phinney called it. He gave the boys
    some pictures showing the falls, and indeed there was a picture of
    the falls upon the side of the breakfast bill of fare.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the forenoon the train was passing through Canada—the boys’
    impression of that country being a succession of flat fields, ragged
    woods, sheep, swine, and a few pretty, long-tailed ponies grazing
    upon browning turf. Philip said that it was like “the Adirondacks
    spread flat by a giantess’s rolling-pin.”
  </p>

  <p>
    At Windsor the train, separated into sections, was run upon a
    ferry-boat (upon which one small room was marked “U. S. Customs”)
    and carried over to Detroit. Here Mr. Douglass made the boys laugh
    by suddenly jumping back from the window. He had been startled by a
    large round brush that was poked against the window from outside to
    dust it.
  </p>

  <p>
    From Detroit the train ran through Michigan—mainly through a flat
    country of rich farming land. Philip, who had never been West, was
    much surprised at the uninterrupted stretches of level ground. Mr.
    Douglass asked him what he thought of the region. Philip adjusted his
    glasses and replied slowly: “Well, it’s fine for the farmers, but it
    is no place for speaking William Tell’s piece about ‘Ye crags and
    peaks, I’m with you once again!’”
  </p>

  <p>
    “You must not forget, though,” said Mr. Douglass, “that it is the
    rich farming lands that really underlie America’s prosperity. When
    you see the Fair, you will understand better what a rich nation we
    are; but without our great wheat-lands we should, like England, be
    dependent upon commerce for our very existence.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The boys were much less talkative as the train neared Chicago. They
    were somewhat tired, and were also thinking of the amount of walking
    and sight-seeing that was before them.
  </p>

  <p>
    All at once, at about half-past five, New York time (for the
    travelers had not yet changed their watches to an hour earlier), Mr.
    Douglass pointed out of the right-hand forward window. Both boys
    looked. There, in the distance, rose above the city houses a gilded
    dome, and from the opposite car-window they saw just afterward a
    spider-web structure.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I know it!” Philip sang out; “that’s the Administration Building.
    But what is the other?”
  </p>

  <p>“The Ferris Wheel,” answered Harry.</p>

  <p>
    “Yes,” said the tutor, “we are going to leave the car not far from
    the Plaisance gate.”
  </p>

  <p>“Sixtieth street next!” cried the brakeman.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">14</span></p>

  <p>
    “Come, we get out here. It’s nearest the grounds, and I have been
    told it is wise to lodge as near as possible.”
  </p>

  <p>
    When the cars stopped, the party descended upon a platform with
    “rails to the right of them, rails to the left of them,” and trains
    and crowds in all directions. Mr. Douglass led the way out into the
    huddled settlement of apartment-houses, hotels, and lodgings that has
    sprung into existence around Jackson Park, the Fair Grounds.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then began their search for rooms. At first it seemed discouraging;
    neatness outside was not always a sign of what to expect inside. They
    labored up-stairs and down again several times. At one attractive
    private house they entered, expecting quiet, homelike rooms. In the
    tiny parlor they found five cots set “cheek by jowl” as close as they
    could be jammed. They smiled at this, but found the rest of the rooms
    as fully utilized. Mr. Douglass made some objection, and was told by
    the self-possessed landlady that “some very fine gentlemen thought
    her fifty-cent beds were very elegant.” At another house they were
    passing, a boy who couldn’t have been over five years old rushed
    out like a little Indian on the warpath, crying, “Hi! You lookin’
    fer rooms?” Amused at the little fellow’s enterprise, our travelers
    followed him, the boy going forward on his sturdy little legs, and
    crying, “Hi, there, Mama! Here’s roomers! I got you some roomers!”
  </p>

  <div class="figright">
    <a id="i_027"><img src="images/i_027.jpg" width="100" height="117" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">“HI, THERE, MAMA!<br />HERE’S ROOMERS!”</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    But unfortunately the boy proved more attractive than the rooms.
    After a long walk, but without going far from the Fair Grounds, they
    took rooms at a very good hotel. The price was high, perhaps, but
    reasonable considering the advantages and the demand for lodgings.
    They took two rooms, one with a double bed for the boys, the other a
    single room for the tutor.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gladly they dropped the satchels that had made their muscles ache,
    and after leaving the keys of their rooms with the hotel clerk,
    they set forth for their first visit to the Fair. In order that
    guests should not forget to leave their keys, each was inserted at
    right angles into a nickel-plated strip of metal far too long to go
    comfortably into the pocket even of an absent-minded German professor.
  </p>

  <p>
    “One advantage of being in a hotel,” said Mr. Douglass, as they
    walked toward the entrance of the grounds, “is the fact that on
    rainy, disagreeable days we can get meals there if we choose. It is
    not always pleasant to have to hunt breakfast through the rain. But
    usually we shall dine where we happen to be in the grounds; there are
    restaurants of all sorts near the exhibits, from a lunch-counter up.”
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">15</span></p>

  <p>
    Along the sidewalk that led from their hotel to the entrance were
    dining-rooms, street-peddlers’ counters, peddlers with trays—all
    meant as inducements to leave money in the great Western metropolis.
    One thing the boys found very amusing was an Italian bootblack’s
    stand surrounded on three sides by a blue mosquito-netting.
  </p>

  <p>
    “If it had been on all sides,” said Harry, “I could have understood
    it, because it might be a fly-discourager. But now I think it must be
    only a way of attracting attention.”
  </p>

  <p>
    They had arrived, luckily, on a “fête night.” Though tired and
    hungry, they all agreed that it would never do not to take advantage
    of so excellent a chance to secure a favorable first impression.
    So they bought tickets at a little wooden booth, and, entering a
    turnstile one by one, were at last in the great White City.

    “<span class="smcap">Well</span>,” remarked Harry, as the wicket turned and let him into the
    grounds, “if any one wishes to take down what I said on entering the
    grounds, he can write down these thrilling words: ‘Here we are at
    last!’”
  </p>

  <p>
    “We won’t try to do more than get a general idea of things to-night,”
    said Mr. Douglass. “We shall find claims upon our eyesight at every
    step. But what a crowd!”
  </p>

  <p>
    The crowd was certainly enormous. At first most of the people seemed
    to be coming out, but this idea was a mistake. It came from the fact
    that those going the same way as our party attracted their attention
    less than those whom they met and had to pass.

  <p>
    They walked between the Pennsylvania Railroad exhibit and the
    Transportation Building, and entered the Administration Building,
    which seemed the natural gateway to the Court of Honor and its
    Basin—always the central point of interest. The paving seemed to be a
    composition not unlike<span class="pagenum">18</span> the “staff” that furnished the material for
    the great buildings, the balustrades, the statues, and the fountains.
    It was just at dusk, and the light was soft and pleasant to the eyes.
    Once in the Administration Building, all our sight-seers threw back
    their heads and gazed up within the dim and distant dome enriched by
    its beautiful frescos.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I have heard,” said the tutor, who felt bound to serve as guide
    so far as his experience would warrant, “that people are unable to
    understand the vastness of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s dome at Rome. This dome is
    even higher, and so I feel sure that, large as it seems to us, our
    ideas of it fall far below the reality. However, we shall see this
    many times. Let us go on through, and see the Court of Honor.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Leaving by the east portal, the three came out upon the broad plaza
    that fronts the basin. By this time the sky was a deep, dark blue,
    and every outline of the superb group of buildings was sharply
    relieved.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a while the three stood silent. There was nothing to say;
    but each of them felt that the work of men’s hands—of the human
    imagination—had never come so near to rivaling Nature’s inimitable
    glories. The full moon stood high above the buildings at their right,
    but even her serenity could not make the great White City seem petty.
  </p>

  <p>
    The boys knew no words to express what they felt. They only knew
    that in their lives they had never been so impressed except when
    gazing upon a glorious sunset, an awe-inspiring thunderstorm, or the
    unmeasured expanse of the ocean.
  </p>

  <p>Philip was the first to speak.</p>

  <p>“<em>Must</em> it be taken down? <em>Why</em> couldn’t they leave it? It is—unearthly!”</p>

  <p>
    “Boys,” said Mr. Douglass, “I don’t preach to you often, and
    certainly there is no need of it now. But, at one time or another,
    each of us has tried to imagine what Heaven could be like. When we
    see <em>this</em>,” and he looked reverently about him, “and remember that
    this is man’s work, we can see how incapable we are of rising to a
    conception of what Heaven might be.”
  </p>

  <p>
    But their rhapsodies could not last long in such a pushing and
    thronging time. People brushed against them, talking and laughing;
    the rolling-chairs zigzagged in and out, finding passageway where
    none appeared; distant bands were playing, and all about them was
    the living murmur of humanity. Groups were sitting upon every
    available space: tired mothers with children, young men chatting, and
    serious-faced country people plodded silently along amid their gayer
    neighbors.

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum">21</span></p>

  <p>
    For a time the three wandered almost without purpose; then, reaching
    the further end of the Basin, they looked back at the superb
    MacMonnies Fountain—the galley that bore the proudly poised figure of
    Progress.
  </p>

  <p>
    Opposite, and facing the fountain, rose the massive but perhaps less
    expressive statue of the Republic. Though the boys were speechless
    with admiration, delight, and wonder, they found—as others have
    done—that fine sights do not satisfy the appetite any better than
    fine words butter parsnips. So Harry turned to Mr. Douglass, saying,
    “Mr. Douglass, don’t you hear the dinner-horn? It seems to me that I
    do.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “All right,” he answered; “let us go over to the Casino restaurant
    and have a comfortable dinner; but first suppose we stop a moment for
    a look into the Electricity Building. I saw by a program posted up
    near the entrance that it is open to-night.”
  </p>

  <p>
    As they came nearer, they found the crowd rapidly increasing in
    density; and when they entered, passing the heroic statue of
    Franklin, they found themselves entirely at the mercy of the moving
    throng of people. So thick were the sight-seers packed that the boys
    could see little except the great Edison Pillar, and that was visible
    only because it rose so high in air. While they watched the pillar,
    incrusted with incandescent lights, different<span class="pagenum">22</span> colored bulbs sprang
    into glowing life or faded out, showing a kaleidoscope of patterns
    changing continually.
  </p>

  <p>
    “We sha’n’t get any dinner if we don’t get out now,” said Philip, who
    was struggling to keep his eye-glasses from being displaced.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Come, then,” said Harry; and they turned to stem the tide.
    For a time they made slight progress; but, luckily, a row of
    wheeling-chairs came charging slowly but firmly, cutting a path by
    gentle persistence. Falling in behind these pioneers, they succeeded
    in escaping to the open air, and then made their way to the Casino.
    Just before reaching this great restaurant, they saw the convent of
    La Rábida, which appeared between the Agricultural Building and the
    Casino.
  </p>

  <p>
    “See!” said Philip. “There’s the model of the convent. Do you know
    what it reminds me of? It is like a little gray nun sitting demurely
    in the corner of a grand ball-room!”
  </p>

  <p>
    And, indeed, the unpretending little building was a distinct rest
    to the eye, after the proud proportions of its surroundings. As the
    statues spoke of the future, the convent reminded one of the past.
  </p>

  <p>
    Entering the Casino brought them back sharply to the present, with
    its needs and its inconveniences. The prosaic need for dinner was
    the first to be thought of, and, enormous as was the restaurant, the
    crowd that night filled every seat, and left plenty of stragglers to
    stand watchfully about, eager to fill themselves and any vacant chair.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Boys,” said the tutor, sadly, “if we stand here an hour, it will be
    only a piece of luck if we find a place. Where shall we go?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I heard a man say that there was a lunch-counter in the southeastern
    corner of the Manufactures, etc., etc., Building,” said Harry. “This
    is no time for French bills of fare and finger-bowls. Come, let’s go
    over there.”
  </p>

  <p>
    No one cared to argue the question, and, keeping the lake on their
    right, they crossed to the largest building, and found a primitive
    lunch-counter on the ground floor. Boys and rough-looking men,
    perched on high stools, shouted out orders to “girls” from eighteen
    to fifty years old.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">“HE’S A COW-BOY.”</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    After waiting a few minutes, Mr. Douglass found a seat, which the
    boys insisted he should take, and a little later they found two
    together. The man who left the seat Harry crowded into had on a
    wide-brimmed felt hat, the edges of which had been perforated all
    around in openwork.
  </p>

  <p>“He’s a cow-boy,” Harry whispered in delighted tones.</p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile Philip was trying to attract the attention of the very
    stout and independent young girl who waited upon that section of the
    counter.<span class="pagenum">23</span> He raised his hand, but she only sneered and remarked,
    “I see yer!” which brought a roar of laughter from some talkative
    customers. Soon, however, she condescended to turn an ear in the
    boys’ direction, and they succeeded in ordering two sandwiches and
    two cups of coffee. When they had finished, Harry said, “Phil, we’ll
    forgive the sandwiches for the sake of the coffee!”
  </p>

    <div class="caption">THE GRAND BASIN FROM A BALCONY OF THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    After this hasty supper, Mr. Douglass told them that there were two
    fine displays that evening—the electric fountains and fireworks on
    the lake-front.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Let us see both,” said Harry. “There’s a place for launches down by
    the Basin, and the man was yelling out when I came by: ‘One launch
    is going to stay awhile in the Basin, and then going out into the
    lake,’—I think he said at half-past seven.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Philip looked at his watch. “We’re too late by half an hour,” he said
    impatiently.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Why, no, Philip,” said Mr. Douglass. “Our watches show New York
    time. We have half an hour to spare.”
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">24</span></p>

  <p>
    “True,” answered the boy. “You are right. I had forgotten that; and,
    by the way, now is a good time to reset our watches.”
  </p>

  <p>
    So they turned the hands back an hour, and felt thankful that another
    sixty minutes had been added to the evening.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">THE PERISTYLE, EAST END OF THE COURT OF HONOR.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    “Now,” said Mr. Douglass, “I have a popular motion to present. It is
    moved that we cease moving, and sit down for a while.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Seconded and carried!” cried Harry; “and, what’s more, I see some
    chairs”; and he pointed to a row that were strangely vacant, while
    all around were occupied. The boys walked toward them. Suddenly
    Harry, who was ahead, came back.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I don’t care to sit down just now,” he said; and his companions,
    coming nearer, saw that the chairs were put over a great break in
    the pavement to warn people away. They turned to walk toward the
    boat-landing, and just then the electric fountains in the corners
    of the Basin nearest the Administration Building began to play.
    Two foamy domes mounted upward, and were magically tinted in fairy
    hues, changing and interchanging, rising and retiring, twisting,
    whirling, and falling in violet, sea-green, pink, purple—it was a
    tiny convention of tamed rainbows. And, meanwhile, from lofty<span class="pagenum">25</span> towers
    great electric sunbeams fell upon the dome of the Administration
    Building, and created a cameo against the sky: upon the MacMonnies
    Fountain, giving it a transfigured snowy loveliness: upon one
    beautiful group after another, bringing them to vivid life. The beams
    were at times full of smoke and spray, that gave a shimmering motion
    to their light.

    “I have been to a circus,” said Harry, “where they had four rings
    going at once. <em>That</em> was bad; but this—this makes me wish I was a
    spider, with eyes all over me.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “The extra legs would not come in badly, either,” said Philip,
    reflectively.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Well said!” agreed Mr. Douglass. “Let us get into the little
    steamer; we can rest there.”
  </p>

  <p>
    They made their way to the landing, bought tickets, stepped aboard
    just as the boat moved off, and were soon gliding gently out upon the
    Basin.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum">27</span></p>

  <p>
    After a short delay to let the passengers view the fountains a little
    longer, the steamer sped under a bridge, through the great arch of
    the Peristyle, and made out into the open lake.
  </p>

  <p>
    To their surprise, the boys found a heavy rolling “sea” on; but as
    soon as the fireworks began, they forgot all else. Rockets, bombs,
    showers of fire, floating lights—they came so rapidly that there was
    a continuous gleam of colored light reflected from the waves. Their
    launch rounded the fireworks station, and then came to a standstill
    not far from the Naval exhibit, the model man-of-war “Illinois.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Soon some of the women passengers began to object to the rolling. One
    Boston woman said: “This is rough; I don’t like this at all”; but
    her bespectacled daughter remarked, as a great bomb of rosy light
    scattered in a rain of fire, “Well, <em>I</em> think it’s the smoothest
    thing I ever saw!” which bit of slang from the prim little Puritan
    was a great delight to the boys. And as the search-light suddenly
    sent its beams into a lady’s face, she nodded cordially, and said, as
    if meeting a friend, “How do you do?” Then, turning to her own party,
    added, “They’ve just found me.”
  </p>

  <div class="figright">
    <a id="i_040"><img src="images/i_040.jpg" width="200" height="237" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">“THERE WAS ROOM FOR ANOTHER<br />
    BOY INSIDE,—AND HARRY<br />MADE A SKETCH OF IT.”</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    There were many little incidents that amused Harry exceedingly. One
    small boy, while boarding the boat, ingeniously contrived to knock
    his hat overboard; it was at once recovered,—a straw hat has no
    chance racing a steamboat,—but, like Mr. McGinty, was exceedingly
    moist. So the pilot went down a dark hatchway and fished out an
    official cap. The boy put it on. The effect was stunning,—there was
    room for another boy inside,—and Harry made a sketch of it.
  </p>

  <p>
    But these trifles were only a relief from the grandeur of the
    display. Philip said it was the Grandest Grand Transformation
    Scene imaginable. After a “set piece” had been shown, there was a
    bombardment of “Fort McHenry,” as they called it—a ship and fort
    outlined in living fire:
  </p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“The rockets’ red glare,</div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    and all the rest of a mimic war. Then, as the fort blew up, the Stars
    and Stripes flamed forth—“Old Glory”—in lines of light; and, far out
    upon the lake as they were, the rapturous cheering of the crowds came
    plainly to their ears.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">28</span></p>

  <p>
    “Benedict Arnold would never have made that awful break of his if he
    could have been here to-night,” said Harry, reflectively; then, as
    Philip began to speak, he said, “Yes, I know he couldn’t have been.
    Thanks.”
  </p>

      Looking toward the Grand Basin from a point between Machinery Hall
      and the Agricultural Building.
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Another thing that added wonderfully to the effect of the fireworks
    was a calliope whistle on some yacht or tug. While the people
    cheered, the musical director of that steam-tug whistle performed
    on it with a master hand. It shrieked, it cheered, it yelled, it
    laughed—whatever song without words could be sung by a steam-whistle
    was performed with variations. And, queer enough, the effect was
    exceedingly pleasing. It somehow seemed in accord with the whole
    spirit of the fête. A bold, generous Western extravagance pervaded
    the whole affair.
  </p>

  <p>
    On their way back, they suddenly saw before them a long black hulk.
    It proved, as they passed it, to be a large yacht lying upon her
    side, with the masts and yards extending out far over the dark waves.
  </p>

  <p>
    “How did that happen?” Mr. Douglass asked the pilot, pointing to the
    wreck.
  </p>

  <p>
    “It was a collision, sir,” replied the pilot; but he gave no
    particulars.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the man seemed busy in guiding the swift little steamer, the
    tutor<span class="pagenum">29</span> recalled the old adage about “not talking to the man at the
    wheel,” and asked no further questions.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the sights of that marvelous American Thousand and One Nights
    combined were not yet over. As they entered the Basin, their steamer
    halted to enable them to witness a diving exhibition. On a floating
    tower stood a man in tights, so lighted up by an electric ray as to
    be clearly visible from every point around. Raising his hands above
    his head, he fell thirty-five feet or more into the water. Just as
    he reached the surface, his hands came swiftly together, and he sank
    like a plummet. In an instant he was up again, kicking a mass of
    gleaming spray into the air. Several more “followed their leader.”

    <div class="caption">EVENING ON THE CANAL.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    It was a thrilling sight, and, on that cold night, chilled the
    spectators to the marrow.
  </p>

  <p>
    As they walked along the edge of the Basin after leaving their
    launch, the boys greatly admired the statues of animals and men set
    up near the balustrade. There was a bull, several great bears, a
    farmer and a draft-horse, a bison (who seemed timid and dwarfed by
    his surroundings), and<span class="pagenum">30</span> others, nearly all modeled with a massive
    effect that gave them wonderful dignity.
  </p>

  <p>
    And still the crowd surged to and fro, but now with a decided
    tendency toward the outlets; the lights flashed and gleamed; the
    bands played, while the great moon sailed overhead as if it was all a
    fête to Diana.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tired as they were when they reached the hotel, the boys could not
    refrain from talking over some of the principal things they had seen.
    They did not say much about the buildings, for they knew they should
    see them again; but they talked of the people, the fireworks, and
    such queer comments as they had overheard.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I expected,” said Philip, “that we should see a great many
    foreigners—Turks, Swedes, Germans, all sorts. But I didn’t. I saw two
    or three fellows with fezzes on, but that was about all.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I noticed that, too,” Harry responded. “And I didn’t hear much but
    English spoken. It seems to me that Uncle Sam has done most of this
    thing himself, and that it’s mainly his own boys that are taking it
    in.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “But it’s early days yet,” said Philip, with a prodigious yawn, “to
    make—aw!—comparisons.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “That looks more like late hours than early days,” Harry suggested.
    “Let’s turn in.”
  </p>

  <p>
    In a few minutes their clothes were on two chairs, and their heads
    were sunk into adjacent pillows.

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">Sunday</span> proved a welcome relief after the long journey of Saturday,
    followed by the fête night at the Fair; and they were glad to begin
    the busy week that was to follow with one restful day apart from
    bustle and confusion.
  </p>

  <p>
    At breakfast Monday morning, one of the dishes Mr. Douglass ordered
    was steak; and, as he sawed through it, he remarked:
  </p>

  <p>“This is tough!”</p>

  <p>
    “But I thought you didn’t approve of slang?” Harry inquired, with an
    air of grave interest.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I wasn’t thinking so much of how I said it as of the fact,” Mr.
    Douglass replied. “But the proverb says that ‘shoemakers’ children
    are always the worst shod,’ and so we ought to expect poor beef in
    Chicago, the great beef-market of the continent; but I don’t like to
    waste my strength on mere beef while there is so much before us. What
    are your plans?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “If you don’t mind,” said Harry, after a moment’s pause, “I’m going
    to ask you to let me ‘paddle my own canoe.’ It is hard for three to
    keep together in a crowd.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “That’s true,” Philip agreed; “and especially when one is
    near-sighted. I think I tried to follow seven different wrong men
    yesterday.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Yes,” added Harry; “‘Follow my leader’ is a difficult game to play
    when we are all leaders and followers at the same time.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “All right,” the tutor said. “To-day, then, we will separate. I may
    not go to the Fair at all, for I have several letters on my mind.
    Remember, we came away on very short notice. What will you do,
    Philip?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Oh, I think I shall spend a long while in the Art Galleries. It’s a
    good place to go to by one’s self, for two people seldom agree about
    pictures—especially boys.”
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">32</span></p>

  <p>
    So, after breakfast, Harry, with a proud feeling of being his own
    master, set forth by himself. He had a very clear idea of what
    he wished to do first. He meant to go to the model of a United
    States man-of-war—the “Illinois.” He had read much about the White
    Squadron, and felt that he would never have so good an opportunity to
    understand just how a man-of-war was worked.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <div class="caption">BUILDING THE BATTLE-SHIP. NOVEMBER, 1891.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    He had bought a guide-book to the Fair, and found that the route of
    the launches would bring him quite near enough to the vessel. But in
    spite of his singleness of purpose, his thoughts were distracted as
    soon as he came near the entrance.
  </p>

  <p>
    He noticed first the clicking of the turnstiles. They revolved so
    continually, as people passed in, that Harry was reminded of the
    sound of a watchman’s rattle. Next, he caught sight of a white-robed
    and turbaned Turk standing in line at the “Workmen’s Gate,” as
    placidly as if he were in his native Constantinople. Harry’s turn
    to enter at the “Pay Gate” soon came, and he made his way toward
    the Court of Honor. As he passed the great Liberty Bell, which was
    chiming musically, he read upon it the words:
  </p>

  <blockquote class="mt2 mb2">
    <p class="center">A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="noindent">
    He could not help remembering what followed the ringing of the
    original Liberty Bell, and he hoped that this, its namesake, would
    bring peace rather than war—a sober reflection that he recalled later
    in the day.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">33</span></p>

  <p>
    To the tune of “Hold the fort, for I am coming,” played by a peal of
    musical bells,—very fittingly, he thought,—Harry began the quick
    journey that ended when the little launch came to a landing called
    “The Clambake.” When the man called out those words, Harry did not
    budge; but when the man added, “Here’s where yer get off,” he rose
    and abandoned the craft.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the way there, Harry learned that the ducks in the Lagoon were
    useful as well as pretty. The pilot said that two or three ducks
    would do more toward keeping a pond wholesome than six or eight
    hard-working men.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <div class="caption">THE BATTLE-SHIP AS IT LOOKED IN JANUARY, 1892.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    He was too early to get upon the “Illinois,” and therefore turned
    back to see the Viking ship. It was not far away; and just in front
    of it were three armor-plates in which were the imprints left by the
    great conical shot used in testing them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Harry had read all about the old Northmen’s vessel, and ordinarily
    could have spent hours in studying her mast, her one crossyard, her
    awning, the shields along her side—but this was a land of wonders. He
    looked at the boat only long enough to take a mental snap-shot that
    he<span class="pagenum">34</span> could develop at leisure, and then walked on toward the United
    States Government Building, passing on his way a company of marines
    at drill.
  </p>

  <p>
    But again he was diverted. He turned into the Weather Bureau, and was
    glad he had done so, because of the wonderful series of photographs
    he found on the walls. Lightning flashes in streaks and sheets,
    clouds in storm and wind, moonlight and snow effects, were there, but
    in impossible numbers. He sighed, wished that he had more leisure,
    and left. This time he succeeded in getting to the rifled cannon in
    front of the Government Building, but stopped only long enough to
    take a sight over one of them.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_047"><img src="images/i_047.jpg" width="700" height="641" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">THE BATTLE-SHIP ON DECORATION DAY, MAY 30, 1893.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    He tried to go regularly around the exhibits, but surrendered almost
    at once. The Patent Office models discouraged him; but the Geological
    Department!—the great transparent pictures in the windows convinced
    him that<span class="pagenum">35</span> he couldn’t (as he once heard a man say) “poss the
    impossible and scrute the inscrutable.”
  </p>

  <p>But he did notice some things.</p>

  <p>
    He sketched the skull of the <i>Dinoceras mirabile</i> (and copied
    the name, too), because he was sure that it was the very ugliest
    thing in the world. He walked around a section of the big tree
    from California. He really studied a few life-like and life-size
    groups showing Indians at work, and wished sincerely that he
    were Methuselah, and that the Fair would last all his days. It
    was a petrified Wild West show. He said they were splendid, to a
    gray-bearded Westerner, who replied emphatically:
  </p>

  <p>“They are <em>so</em>—and I have been used to the scoundrels all my life!”</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_048"><img src="images/i_048.jpg" width="700" height="364" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT BUILDING.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Harry sketched a queer Indian “priest-clown’s” head. At first he felt
    a little afraid to bring out his book and pencil; but he found out
    that every one had more to do than watch a boy drawing, and before
    the day was over he drew whatever he chose, entirely forgetting the
    crowd.
  </p>

  <p>
    Different things attracted different people. He heard one
    farmer-looking man say: “My stars, Ma! Look-a here!” and expected
    to see a marvel. He found only some stuffed chickens. Probably the
    farmer had never seen fowls stuffed unroasted.
  </p>

  <p>
    But when he came to the War Department collection he gave up
    skipping. He <em>had</em> to see that. Just at the entrance was a splendid
    bust of General Sheridan, the face wearing the expression the general
    must have had when he said at Winchester, “Turn around, boys! We’re
    going<span class="pagenum">36</span> back!” Against the windows were more fine transparencies, and
    the whole floor-space was filled with everything having to do with
    war and soldiers. Small arms, from a brass blunderbuss to the latest
    breech-loader—yes, and to the earliest, for there was one Chinese
    breech-loader of the 14th century.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_049"><img src="images/i_049.jpg" width="600" height="479" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">THE VIKING SHIP.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    “Instead of trying to get up new things,” said Harry, half aloud, “we
    ought to go to China and study ancient history.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Harry had a feeling of discouragement in spite of his interest. He
    had always entertained a vague idea that some day he might give his
    mind to it and make a big invention—a phonograph or a flying railway,
    or some little thing like that; but now, when he saw how everything
    seemed to have been done, and done better than he could have dreamed
    of—well, he said to himself, “This Fair has spoiled one great
    inventor, for I would not dare to think there was anything new!”
  </p>

  <p>
    But then he caught sight of a picture called the “March of
    Time,”—representing a great procession of soldiers, of generals
    and veterans,—which restored his good spirits, for right in front,
    “leading the whole crowd,” was a row of rollicking small boys. He was
    grateful to the artist.
  </p>

  <p>
    One stand of arms showed muskets—relics of the Civil War—injured by
    bullets. Into one of them a Confederate bullet had entered to stop
    a forthcoming<span class="pagenum">37</span> shot, and, meeting, they had burst open the barrel.
    Another had been split into ribbons at the muzzle. There were also
    relics of the Custer massacre, and a gun recaptured from an Indian
    after he had tastefully ornamented it with brass-headed nails.
  </p>

  <p>
    The less bloody side of battle was recalled by General Thomas’s
    “office wagon,” the side of which formed a desk when lowered, and
    revealed some very neat pigeonholes for papers, pens, and red tape.
    Uniforms and equipment, models of pontoons, artillery, a model of
    undermining, one by one each claimed the hasty glance that was
    all any visitor had to spare. A longer look was claimed by an oil
    painting showing Lieutenant Lockwood’s observation of the “Farthest
    North.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Then Harry returned to the Rotunda, and executed a rapid circular
    movement, hasty, but full of reverence, toward the cases of
    Revolutionary and Colonial relics—portraits on ivory, letters, flags,
    snuff-boxes—an endless array of antiquities. Harry was glad to see
    one miniature, excellently painted, by Major André; for up to that
    day he had not thought much of the unfortunate major’s drawing,
    having seen only the well-known “sketch of himself” in pen and ink.
    Washington’s diary was another thing the boy found very interesting:
    as he said, it was “neat as wax and right as a trivet.” Harry
    wondered whether it wouldn’t be fun to keep a diary. This reminded
    him of the flight of time, and, looking at his watch, he set his face
    once more toward the “Illinois,” for it was after half-past ten.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many were going that way—and, indeed, in every other. Two small boys
    who, in sailor suits, strode along the pier like two pygmy admirals,
    gave him another subject for his sketch-book; but they were but atoms
    in a long procession, for there was no cessation in the coming and
    going of visitors all the time he was on the vessel.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">TWO LITTLE TARS GOING<br />
    TO SEE THE MODEL<br />OF A MAN-OF-WAR.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    He went at once below decks, and came plump up against an
    ice-machine—“to keep the men cool while in action,” he heard a young
    fellow say. Around the bulkheads were draped flags of all nations,
    and here and there were hung mess-lockers,—shelves behind wire
    gratings,—hammocks, neatly varnished kegs for stores, and everything
    Jack afloat could desire. Upon the lower deck also were glass cases
    protecting exquisite models of the new cruisers and battle-ships.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Now, if they’ll give me just one of those as my share,” said Harry,
    “I’ll go home contented. Anyway, I think I will go to Annapolis and
    become an officer in the navy.”
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">38</span></p>

  <p>
    As if to answer this thought, he came next to the room where the work
    of the cadets was shown. The splicing, the foot-ball statistics,
    the fencing foils and masks, were welcomed; but the tables full of
    text-books and the neat drawings on the walls spoke so plainly of
    hard study and long hours of work that Harry’s determination was
    somewhat shaken. And, indeed, before he had left the Government
    Building, a soldier of the regular army, guarding some exhibits, had
    said to him, “The time for war is over.” The man seemed to speak
    seriously, and then it was that Harry recalled the new Liberty Bell
    and its inscription. War was not all uniforms and parading.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">THE CARAVEL “SANTA MARIA.”<br />The Model of the Flagship of Columbus.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The captain’s room and office were most attractive, except that a set
    of the “Encyclopædia Britannica” seemed out of its element—a British
    book with a Latin name hardly rhymed with a United States man-of-war.
  </p>

  <p>
    A courteous officer on the “Illinois” told Harry that people’s
    questions were at times hard to answer. “One man,” he said, “looked
    long at the Howell torpedo, read the labels, and with keen interest
    wanted to know whether it wasn’t a flying machine!”
  </p>

  <p>
    Harry thought that he might have been told that it was a machine to<span class="pagenum">39</span>
    make other machines fly; but he didn’t interrupt the officer, who
    gave him a clear explanation of a life-buoy hanging in the cabin.
  </p>

  <p>
    While ascending to the upper deck, he heard a woman say, “Oh, is
    there another story?” and wished Rudyard Kipling had been there to
    tell her that it was <em>quite</em> another story. But he made his way to
    the conning-tower, paying heed to the admonition of a mischievous boy
    who said, “Push, but don’t shove.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The conning-tower was hardly big enough to lose one’s temper in, but
    gave the commanding officer full view of his surroundings through
    tiny slits cut through the solid steel. Electric buttons were
    convenient to push when he wished the guns, rifles, torpedoes, and
    other assistants to do the rest.
  </p>

  <p>
    Leaving the vessel, Harry was again launched back to the other end of
    the grounds, landing at the Agricultural Building. He passed through
    this great show-house with his eyes well restrained, but did notice
    some birds flying about under the lofty roof. He wondered if they had
    come to study the best methods of securing a living at the farmers’
    expense, and hoped rather that they wished to know what harmful
    insects it was best for them to destroy.
  </p>

  <p>
    After eating lunch at a table in the open air near by, Harry boarded
    Columbus’s “Santa Maria.” Coming directly from a modern cruiser,
    the quaint little cockle-shell was a pathetic witness to the great
    discoverer’s hardships. Harry went into the forecastle, looked at the
    queer old galley, the swivel-gun, the anchors, and wished that he
    had been aboard the original on that first westward trip. The modern
    vessels were scientific, correct, and fine, of course; but somehow
    Harry would rather have sailed the ocean blue in the days when the
    galley-fires flared fitfully on these pictured sails.
  </p>

  <div class="figright">
    <a id="i_052"><img src="images/i_052.jpg" width="150" height="146" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">“GUARDING”<br />THE “NIÑA.”</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    He skipped the “Pinta” and “Niña,” sketching from the shore a sailor
    on the latter who was “guarding” the little vessel, only reflecting
    that those on the biggest vessel were better off than their fellows
    in these two, and went over to the Convent de la Rábida. Harry
    thought everybody knew about that building; but he met a group of
    three men, one of whom asked in all earnestness, “That hain’t the
    Fisheries Buildin’, is it?” Then the boy remembered how amused the
    great Napoleon was when they brought to his court a man who had never
    heard of him, of the Empire, or of the Revolution! Harry<span class="pagenum">40</span> wondered
    whether there might not be in the Fair Grounds a few who hardly
    recalled having heard of a man named Columbus.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside the convent were old charts, pictures, and manuscripts, to
    which Harry gave but a passing glance. But the open court inside at
    once gave him a sense of antiquity, and the tropical plants recalled
    thoughts of distant lands, until he caught sight of a tired man
    worrying a piece of mince-pie for lunch. He started to go out, and
    only paused before an old globe whereon the lands were full of odd
    pictures.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_053"><img src="images/i_053.jpg" width="700" height="586" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">THE NEW “SANTA MARIA” CROSSING THE OCEAN.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    “Geography must have been like a book of fairy-stories then,” he
    thought as he left the convent door and came face to face with to-day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Oh, but he was tired! His legs ached, his back was lame, and he felt
    like the deacon’s “one-hoss shay”—as if he might give out “all at
    once and nothing first.” Seeing in the distance the movable sidewalk,
    it occurred to him that it was a good place for resting.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">41</span></p>

  <p>
    The convent had been a little depressing. Others felt the same
    effect, for he heard one woman say, “I’m glad I’m not a monk”—and
    then, after a reflective pause—“nor a nun.”
  </p>

  <p>
    As he approached the traveling platform that ran on wheels far out
    along a pier, this cry met him:
  </p>

  <p>
    “This way for the movable sidewalk! An all-day ride for five
    cents—the cheapest thing on the grounds!”
  </p>

  <p>
    It was irresistible. Harry stepped on the slower platform, then to
    the quicker one, and dropped into a seat. It proved an excellent
    change. Out he glided upon the long pier, rested and cooled by the
    breeze and by the sight of the placid waters, now an opaline green
    in the afternoon light. Harry thought less of the scene than of his
    muscles.
  </p>

  <p>
    “If I wanted to make money at this Fair,” he said, “I would put on
    sale a patent back-rest and double-back-action support; and after the
    Fair it could be sold to farmers for weeding.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Harry made the round trip, and got off nearly where he started. He
    did not wish to go back to the hotel, but he could not really enjoy
    anything more, though so long as he could walk he wanted to see, see,
    see. Nor was it all seeing; a blind man would have enjoyed that day,
    so many funny remarks were made, so much music was in the air. Bands
    played, wheels whirled, people chatted, laughed, and exclaimed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Everybody seemed happy, perhaps because with all the sight-seeing
    there went plenty of enjoyable exercise in the clear, bracing
    September air.
  </p>

  <p>
    As for Harry, he returned to the hotel healthily weary, but not
    exhausted.

    <span class="smcap">Harry’s</span> route to his hotel lay through the usual throng of men whose
    one object in life was to make people buy “a splendid meat supper for
    twenty-five cents!” His legs felt like stilts, and he walked only
    because he had become so used to it that he could not stop.
  </p>

  <p>
    As it was still an hour or two before their usual dinner-time, Harry
    went up to his room, intending to lie down for a while. When he asked
    at the counter for the key, the clerk told him that his friend “with
    the eye-glasses” was already in their room.
  </p>

  <p>Harry found Philip lying on the bed, tired but looking contented.</p>

  <p>
    “Why, you’re home early,” said Harry, in surprise. “I thought you
    were going to spend the whole day in the Art Gallery.”
  </p>

  <p>

    “I started for there. Where have you been?”

    “Oh, to the Government Building, the man-of-war, the convent, the
    caravels—and a lot more,” said Harry, as he flung himself upon the
    bed, first having made himself comfortable by removing his jacket and
    shoes.
  </p>

  <p>“Did you like it?”</p>

  <p>
    “Like it? Of course I liked it, old slowcoach! But it’s too much like
    being invited to two Thanksgiving dinners—enough is better than two
    feasts.”
  </p>

  <p>“What did you see?” asked Philip.</p>

  <p>
    “See here, Phil,” said Harry, smiling mischievously; “do you think I
    am unable to take a view through a millstone with a hole in it? You
    needn’t think you can put me off by asking questions. What I want to<span class="pagenum">44</span>
    know is why you didn’t get to the Art Building. It’s not small, you
    know; you could hardly have passed it without noticing it. Come, out
    with it, young fellow.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “To tell the truth,” said Phil reluctantly, but laughing
    good-naturedly, “I started out all right, for I looked up the way
    in the guide-book. I found that the cheapest and quickest plan was
    to take the railway on the grounds—the Intra—something; yes, the
    Intramural, which means ‘within the wall.’”

  <p>
    “So it does,” answered Harry. “Great thing to know Latin. But fire
    away. I can see there is more in this Fair than a whole brigade of
    boys can see. Let’s hear what you did.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I took the railway, climbing a lot of steps, and we started. They
    had signs to tell one where to go, but I couldn’t read them very
    well, and so I went whizzing along without altogether understanding
    where I was. The stations they called out meant nothing to me, and I
    had an idea it took a good while to get across the grounds; and—to
    make it short—I was looking at the view, first one side, toward the
    hotels, and then the other, toward the Fair Buildings, and I didn’t
    wake up to my position till the conductor said, ‘Going round again,
    young man?’ So I got off, for there I<span class="pagenum">45</span> was at the same station I got
    on at. You see, the conductor had noticed me because I sat near where
    he stood.”

  </div>

  <p>“That’s a good one on you!”</p>

  <p>
    “I know it. But I didn’t like to start over again, so I came down
    the steps and walked over across the Court of Honor, along by the
    Agricultural Building, till I came to the caravels and the convent.
    I saw those, but so did you. I went next to the Krupp gun exhibit by
    the lake. That gun was enormous! I believe all the gunners could get
    inside when it rained. They had a printed label on it, and at first
    I read it: ‘Please set off the gun’; but I knew that wasn’t likely,
    so I went nearer, and found it said ‘keep’ instead of ‘set.’ Oh, by
    the way, just before I went in there, I stopped in the doorway and
    saw some men diving from a tremendous height, out in the lake,—a much
    higher tower than the one they dived from on the fête night. I also
    saw in the Krupp building a pretty little model of the house the
    great gunmaker lived in when he began.”
  </p>

  <p>“What was it like?” asked Harry.</p>

  <p>
    “Oh, just a little square thatched house; but you could see the tiny
    furniture through the windows. I didn’t stay long there, for they
    were sprinkling the floor, and it was sloppy.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Next I went into the Leather Exhibit Building; but there were mostly
    shoes and things there, and I didn’t see very much I cared about,
    except some buckskin suits labeled ‘indestructible.’ I would have
    liked one of those, except that it was trimmed with silver lace.”
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">46</span></p>

  <p>“A little gaudy for you,” said Harry.</p>

  <p>
    “Yes, but they were fine. So, seeing signs telling people to go up
    into the gallery where shoes were being made, I went up. I heard
    machines making a racket, but all I saw was the backs of the other
    people who got there first.”
  </p>

  <p>“I know,” said Harry; “I made a sketch of one of those very exhibits.”</p>

  <p>“Now, where did I go next? Let me see the map—it’s there by you.”</p>

    <div class="caption">“DON’T FAIL TO SEE<br />THIS EXHIBIT.”</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Harry passed over the little plan of the grounds, and Philip examined
    it a moment. Then he went on:
  </p>

  <p>
    “I see now. I meant to go into the Forestry Building, but on the way
    I caught sight of some things in the Anthro—”
  </p>

  <p>
    “—Thropo-pop-o-ological,” interrupted Harry. “It’s a nice word to say
    when you’re in a hurry.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Yes,” Philip replied, “that was it; so I went in there. And I tell
    you, you mustn’t miss that. It’s fine. It has everything in it.”
  </p>

  <p>“So they all have,” said Harry, hopelessly.</p>

  <p>
    “But there are gymnasium things, and African weapons, all sorts of
    savage huts and costumes, Greek statues, and views, and bits of work
    from the prisons and reformatories, showing how boys are drilled and
    trained to work at trades. But, as usual, I didn’t think I could see
    everything, and so I looked at only a few special cases. One that I
    remember well showed all sorts of games and puzzles—chess, cards,
    checkers, halma, pachisi, Indian sticks for throwing like dice, the
    fifteen puzzle, ring puzzles, wire puzzles, all sorts. The chessmen
    were splendid. There was one Chinese set there, where the pieces
    stood on pedestals showing three balls carved one inside the other;
    and the pieces themselves were little mandarins and things, with
    faces, and beards, and all. There were enough games in the cases for
    a boy to learn a new one every day as long as he lived.”
  </p>

  <p>“Well?” asked Harry, as Philip paused.</p>

  <p>“You don’t want me to tell it all, do you?” Philip asked.</p>

  <p>
    “If you will,” said Harry. “My ears are the only things about me that
    are not tired; and I am resting the rest of me.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “All right,” said Philip; “I’m willing. I am so full of it, I could
    talk a week. But I remember now there was one place I went before the
    Anthropo Building, and that was to a real log cabin, with all the
    regular old-fashioned things in it; but never mind, I won’t go back
    to that, for I’ve a lot more to tell, and one thing I know you’ll
    like to hear about specially.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">47</span></p>

  <p>
    “The next queer thing was the Cliff-dwellers’ mound, a big structure,
    made to look like red rock,—sandstone, maybe,—in which these old
    Indians in the Southwest used to live. I didn’t go into it, although
    a lot of signs said I ought to; but I saw how the little caves were
    hollowed out and made into huts, with doors and windows. While I was
    looking up at it—and it is a high cliff, I tell you!—I saw some nuns
    all in black climbing over it, and that was a strange sight enough.
    Out in front were some gray little donkeys,—‘burros,’ used by the
    exploring party that found the caves. Then I went on to an old-time
    distillery, outside of which was a real ‘moonshiner’s’ still that had
    been captured by the revenue officers.

    <div class="caption">AN ALASKAN IMAGE.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    “Then I came to some Alaskan houses. They were made of great rough
    slabs, with circular doors cut through the trunks of trees in front.
    There were little models of them in the Anthropo place, too. In front
    of them stood those carved totem-poles that we used to see in the
    physical geography book. I saw by the labels on the models that those
    poles were meant to tell the history of the man in the house behind
    each one, and that the more rings there were on the carved man’s high
    hat, the more of a fellow the owner was. There seemed to be lots
    about whales on them. I suppose capturing a whale was to them like
    being elected to Congress—maybe harder.
  </p>

  <p>
    “But, speaking of whales, the next thing I saw was the one I want to
    tell you specially about. Near the shore there, in what they call the
    South Pond, was an old-fashioned vessel. I walked over toward it, and
    read the signs. They said it was a whaling-vessel, a regular old New
    Bedford whaler. You know about those?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I guess I do,” said Harry. “I remember reading ‘Peter, the Whaler,’
    and a lot more books like it.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Well, at first I wasn’t going in, for they charged a quarter, and
    there didn’t seem to be many going on board. I was afraid it was not
    good for anything, but at last I made up my mind to risk twenty-five
    cents on it. I bought my ticket and climbed the gang-plank. There
    were just two other men on board besides the sailor in charge.”
  </p>

  <p>“‘Two other men’ is good,” remarked Harry.</p>

  <p>
    “You know what I mean. When we got up on deck, the sailor came
    forward to speak his little piece. He said if we wanted to know how
    they caught whales he’d tell us. Then he went on with the whole
    thing, from ‘Thar she blows!’ down to the cutting up and trying-out
    of blubber.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">48</span></p>

  <p>
    “I had often read about it, but I tell you, Harry, it was different
    to see him hold up the harpoon and the lance, the gun for firing a
    big harpoon and all. And then we saw the vats for boiling the oil.
    And he said that out of the whale’s head they could dip up whole
    barrels of clear oil; but the whalebone was the thing they were after
    nowadays. He said they sometimes got thousands of dollars’ worth out
    of the mouth of one whale.
  </p>

  <p>
    “After he finished telling about whaling, he invited us below, to
    see a collection of marine curiosities they had on board. It was a
    regular old-style ship, with the beams coming close down to your
    head. All around were cases of curious things—real sailors’ oddities:
    carved teeth and shells, swords from sword-fish, idols, weapons,
    tools—whatever a sailor could collect. One thing I remember was a
    harpoon-head that had been bent and twisted around itself by a whale
    till it looked like a scrawl in a copy-book. Then we went forward to
    the forecastle, to see the queer little bunks where the men sleep.

  <p>
    “As I was coming away I bought a little book telling all about the
    old ship; and it is interesting, I tell you. I haven’t read it all
    yet, but one adventure of that ship the sailor told us about.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">49</span></p>

  <p>
    “She was out with a big fleet, more than thirty, and she was one of
    the six that got out from an ice-pack. Then a boat came along after,
    and reported the rest of the ships as wrecked. The ‘Progress’—that’s
    the one I’m telling about—and the other saved vessels threw all their
    valuable cargo over and took in the poor fellows from the ice. That
    was what I call square. You can read all about it later. Wouldn’t you
    like to?”

  <p>
    There was no answer. Philip turned to look at Harry more closely, and
    found that the tired boy had fallen fast asleep.
  </p>

  <p>
    “It’s all right for him to go to sleep,” said Philip to himself, “but
    I wish he’d say so when he does it; then I’d know when to stop.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Harry awoke in time for dinner. Mr. Douglass had mailed a number of
    letters, and he and the boys went to the table together. They found
    that their walks had given them the best of appetites, and they
    enjoyed seeing the people at the various tables around them. Mr.
    Douglass spoke of the excellent appearance made by the crowds, and of
    their good-humor.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I was in the Fair Grounds for a short time this afternoon,” he said,
    “and I found myself noticing the people quite as much as the curious
    things around me. If one ran against another, there was never any
    ill-humor or crossness. Usually both apologized politely. And yet
    in many places the crowds were enormous. Again and again I would look
    ahead of me, and think that I couldn’t get through the throng.”
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum">51</span></p>

  <p>
    “I noticed that, too,” said Philip; “but the spaces are big and the
    people keep moving, so somehow one always finds a place to pass.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I tell you what I liked,” said Harry; “and that was the little
    drinking-fountains, where you drop a penny and get a glass of spring
    water. I found them very welcome.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “And the popcorn!” said Philip. “I don’t like it much, but I saw it
    everywhere. Why, you could smell it in the air sometimes; and every
    now and then you would hear a crackle-crackle, snap-snap, and there
    would be a popper full of dancing corn over hot coals.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Yes, I saw them,” said Mr. Douglass. “I found it very interesting
    to talk to the people. Now and then, when I wished to rest awhile,
    I would sit down on a bench; and pretty soon a man would come up
    and drop into a seat beside me. Then, in a minute, one of us would
    say: ‘It’s a fine day,’ or something of the kind, and, without
    difficulty, a little talk would begin. One man I met told me he was
    from Massachusetts, and cultivated tobacco. We had a very pleasant
    conversation, and gave each other advice about what to see. I think
    this Fair will do a great deal to bring people together.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “It has already,” said Harry, solemnly. “I have seen a number come
    together even to-day. Where did you go this afternoon, Mr. Douglass?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I went to the Art Gallery part of the time,” the tutor replied. “But
    I found it, like the other buildings, too overwhelming—whole rooms
    full of masterpieces of painting and sculpture; something demanding
    at least a glance wherever one looked. I found I could not stay long.
    Walking about and looking upward and downward, and from side to side,
    is more than any one can endure very long. Besides, the pictures are
    so good that they make one both think and feel keenly, and that is
    tiring, too. So after about two hours I surrendered, and came out.
    I walked along the lake shore during part of my way back, purposely
    avoiding any sights of especial interest.”
  </p>

  <p>“What shall we do to-morrow?” asked Philip.</p>

  <p>
    “Whatever you please,” answered the tutor. “Perhaps you might do some
    photographing, Philip.”
  </p>

  <p>“I’d like to, but I hardly know where to begin.”</p>

  <p>
    “Suppose,” said Harry, “that we all three go to the Midway Plaisance?
    It’s a splendid place to get pictures.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “But I hear,” said Philip, “that you can’t do very much photographing
    there. You can get a permit for the Fair Grounds, but the Plaisance<span class="pagenum">52</span>
    exhibits are outside of the Fair’s control, and you have to secure
    special permissions there.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “We might try it,” said Mr. Douglass. “You have brought your big
    kodak, haven’t you?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Yes, with a new roll of forty-eight films in it,” said Philip. “But
    I shall have to take outdoor scenes, for there’s little chance to
    give time-exposures.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Well, suppose that we hire chairs to-morrow—the rolling-chairs, you
    know. One can hire either double chairs or single ones; and then we
    three will be wheeled out to the Midway Plaisance. There we will let
    the chairs go, and see what we can do. How do you like it, Harry?”
  </p>

    <div class="caption">A LAUNCH-LANDING.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    “Oh, it suits me,” said Harry. “To tell the truth, I should like
    to go there soon, for there are so many really foreign scenes in
    the streets and villages that it may be I can get some good little
    sketches. At all events, I’d like to go to the Wild Animal show, and
    see it all. I met a boy to-day, while I was at lunch, who said that
    it beat any circus he ever saw.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “There are a number of absurd cheap shows on the Midway,” said Mr.
    Douglass, “at least, so the guide-books say; but we can go to the
    best of<span class="pagenum">53</span> them, and let the others alone. I find that the people (as
    I have told you) are more interesting to me than are most of the
    exhibits, and the Plaisance is always crowded.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The party had finished dinner, and they went up to their rooms;
    Philip got out his camera, and looked it over, to be sure all was in
    working order. Harry laid out his sketch-book and an extra pencil.
    Mr. Douglass, as he usually did, read over his guide-books, and made
    up his accounts. But all three went early to bed.

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">The</span> dauntless three reached the gates next morning at about nine
    o’clock, and found an even larger crowd than usual. They had to form
    in line at some distance from the ticket-office, and advanced toward
    it as slowly as people come out of church. But, as before, good humor
    was the rule, and, excepting for a few of the weak-minded men who
    always fight their way through a crowd, there was every effort made
    to accommodate one another.
  </p>

  <p>
    Philip heard a woman say, “Why, we are all here to have a good time,
    and to let other people have the same.” It was worst just in passing
    the wickets, but once through, the trouble was at an end.
  </p>

  <p>
    “How shall we go toward the Plaisance?” Mr. Douglass asked. He felt
    that the expedition was undertaken for the boys’ pleasure, and wished
    them to have their own way about it.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Why don’t you take the Intramural, as I did yesterday?” Philip
    asked. “It will give you and Harry a new view of the grounds, and
    it’s a very short ride to the other end.”
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">56</span></p>

  <p>
    “All right,” said Harry; “but we must keep our wits about us. I knew
    a boy once who was carried back to where he started from.”

  <p>
    For this little dig, Philip gently knocked Harry’s hat over his eyes.
    Harry left the hat untouched until Philip put it back in place. “I
    don’t care how I wear my hat,” said Harry, “so long as it is in the
    very latest style.”
  </p>

  <p>
    As they got on the cars, Mr. Douglass noticed that the gates along
    the sides were all opened and shut at once by the conductor, and at
    some stations there were large signs saying, “Don’t climb over the
    gates. They will be opened.”
  </p>

  <p>
    When they were just westward of the Horticultural Building, Harry
    remarked, “There is no need of getting into the large crowds,—there
    is plenty of room over there, and only one man has found it worth
    while to occupy the space.”

    Philip looked where Harry pointed, and saw a workman climbing up a
    dizzy little stairway half-way to the top of the great glass dome.
  </p>

  <p>
    “If he should fall through, he’d break a lot of glass,” said Philip,
    reflectively.
  </p>

  <p>
    They left the railway near the mammoth Building of Manufactures, and
    walked to its northern entrance. Here Mr. Douglass secured their
    chairs, the young men who pushed them having the time of starting
    noted upon cards that they kept neatly inside their caps. Wheeling
    into line, they rode comfortably along through the parting crowd,
    Philip carrying his kodak upon his knees, ready for business. He had
    secured a little card, tied to a<span class="pagenum">57</span> string, that permitted him to take
    pictures “with a four-by-five camera only” for that one day. He had
    paid two dollars for this privilege, and felt bound to use up his
    roll of forty-eight exposures.
  </p>

  <p>
    At first the boys found their chairs a little uncomfortable; but the
    guides raised the foot-rests until their short legs could reach them,
    and after that they found the vehicles as comfortable as an arm-chair
    in a library. It was a bright, clear day—“Just the day for taking
    snap-shots,” Philip said enthusiastically; and everything was plainly
    outlined by sharp contrasts of light and shade.
  </p>

  <p>
    As usual, Mr. Douglass began to talk to his guide, and learned that
    the young man was a college student who was rolling a chair at the
    Exposition partly for the money he made and partly for the sake of
    seeing the Fair and the people from all parts of the world. As Mr.
    Douglass had worked his own way through college, he was able to give
    his guide some practical advice, which was gratefully received.

  </div>

  <p>
    Passing along in front of the Illinois State Building—always
    conspicuous for its dome—they passed around the Women’s Building,
    and came to the entrance of the mile of curious structures that made
    up the<span class="pagenum">58</span> Midway Plaisance. But before they had come so far, the boys,
    too, were talking to their guides, who proved to be other college men.
  </p>

  <p>
    A thing one of them told the boys amused them. The guide said that
    people, intending to be considerate, would lean far forward when
    the chair was pushed up a slope. “And that,” he said, “brings all
    their weight on the little guiding-wheels in front, where there are
    no springs. Then the wheels turn hard, and we have to ask them to
    sit back. So, you see, the kindest people sometimes give the most
    trouble.”
  </p>

    <div class="caption">THE WATER-WHEEL IN THE JAVANESE VILLAGE.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    In spite of this warning, when they were ascending the first
    bridge—one that led across an opening from the Lagoon—both boys
    leaned forward, as one does in “helping” a horse up hill. But when
    the guides laughed, the two boys quickly sank back again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Passing under the elevated railway, they joined the ranks of visitors
    to the Midway. As they intended to come back another time, they
    glanced only at the exteriors of most of the buildings, pausing first
    when they came to the Javanese village. While they rode through the
    crowd the boys were amused to see the odd glances of those who met
    them. The luxury of being pushed in a chair was, by many of the newer
    visitors, considered<span class="pagenum">59</span> fitting only for sick people, and their eyes
    plainly said that two strong, healthy boys should walk. The boys knew
    this, for they had had the same feeling toward riders during their
    own first day; the second day’s walking, however, entirely changed
    their views, and they understood that it was a wise economy to save
    bodily tire when eyes and brain were so busy.

    <div class="caption">THE JAVANESE MUSICIANS.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    “You can ride right into the Javanese village,” one of the guides
    told them; so they bought their tickets and were pushed into the
    grounds.
  </p>

  <p>
    Surrounded by a bamboo fence with a lofty gateway was a collection
    of steep-roofed, grass-thatched, one-story huts. Each had a
    little veranda in front, and as it was sunny, many of the short,
    dark-skinned little people sat outdoors at work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here Philip expected to get a few more pictures. He had already taken
    one outside. Leaving the chair in the main roadway, he had gone to
    the side, where the ground was higher, and had secured a negative (or
    hoped he had!) showing the crowd thronging the long street between
    the houses.
  </p>

  <p>
    But on entering the Javanese village he was told that he could not
    take pictures without another permit. After a little search and
    inquiry he found<span class="pagenum">60</span> a hut within an inclosure marked “private” and
    “office.” Here he met the superintendent, and was given permission to
    take views inside the village.
  </p>

  <div class="figleft">

    <div class="caption">THE JAVANESE BABY.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    All the time they were among the Javanese, they had heard a queer
    musical, liquid pounding. Near the center of the grounds they found
    the cause. An odd water-wheel of bamboo revolved beneath a stream
    that flowed from an upright iron pipe, and as this wheel went around
    it struck short hanging bits of wood that gave forth the musical
    notes. The wheel had apparently no other purpose than to make a
    noise—it was a primitive music-box. This was Philip’s first camera
    subject.
  </p>

  <p>
    His second was also musical. There was a band of musicians playing
    upon some sweet-sounding metal gongs, and another species of Javanese
    tom-toms. The musicians smiled encouragingly as Philip waved his
    camera and gazed through his glasses with eager inquiry, and as soon
    as they were hard at their music Philip took them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another picture he lost. While he was just on the point of pushing
    the button, a guard clapped one hand over the lens. It was too late
    to stop, and Philip lost his temper as well as his exposure.
  </p>

  <p>“You can’t take pictures here,” said the guard.</p>

  <p>“The superintendent said I could,” said Philip, sharply.</p>

  <p>“I beg your pardon,” the guard answered politely.</p>

  <p>
    “That’s all right,” Philip said in a pleasanter tone; “but it doesn’t
    give me back the negative. Next time, please find out before you
    interfere.”
  </p>

  <p>
    In all the foreign exhibits there were seen many objects with which
    the boys were only too familiar. For instance, looking through the
    door of a Javanese hut, Harry saw three cheap American clocks, all
    in a row; and on the veranda of the same house a man was presiding
    over a sewing-machine plainly inscribed with a well-known American
    trade-mark. Nevertheless, the little Javanese themselves were unusual
    enough: the men wore turbans<span class="pagenum">61</span> of figured cotton, a tight-fitting
    jacket, and then, above their trousers, a short skirt or apron that
    hung about half-way down the thigh. Some also wore above their
    turbans wide straw hats.
  </p>

  <div class="figright">

    <div class="caption">“THE MAN STOOD UP BESIDE HER, AND THEY<br />WERE PHOTOGRAPHED TOGETHER.”</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    One of the women had a cute little baby in her arms. Philip put
    a silver coin into the baby’s hand, and was allowed to take its
    picture. But the father held the child. Philip said to Harry, as they
    walked away, “There’s a pretty baby”; then, hearing a gentle chuckle
    from a motherly-looking woman near him, hastened to add: “For that
    kind of a baby.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The party had left their chairs in a corner of the village, and were
    now on foot. As they walked around the inclosure they saw a woman
    and girl embroidering upon a veranda. The girl was about twelve or
    thirteen years old, had a tinge of pink in her cheeks, snappy black
    eyes, and shiny coarse hair.
  </p>

  <div class="figleft">
    <a id="i_074a"><img src="images/i_074a.jpg" width="250" height="449" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">“HE WAS LAZILY<br />SUNNING HIMSELF.”</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Philip wanted a picture of her, and, after a talk with the man of
    the house, at last gained his consent. Philip had a little trouble
    in making the man comprehend that the girl must come out into the
    sunshine; but by pointing to the sun and to a side of the hut that
    was in its full glare, he finally had the little model, blushing
    prettily, posed in a good situation. The man stood up beside her, and
    they were photographed together.
  </p>

  <p>
    No sooner had Philip raised his camera than the sight-seers gathered
    eagerly about him, until he could hardly find space to reach the<span class="pagenum">62</span>
    button. He pushed it in a hurry, and made his way out. Just a moment
    after, he secured an even better subject, entirely by accident.
    Upon another veranda sat a mature Javanese gentleman crouched down
    upon his heels. He was lazily sunning himself, and Philip leveled
    the camera and took him before he could say the Javanese for “Jack
    Robinson.” The man opened his blinking eyes at the click of the
    shutter, but only smiled indulgently, and resumed his basking, like a
    frog on a log.

  <p>
    Leaving the Javanese village, and ignoring upon their way the appeals
    of a vender of Java cigarettes—“Ver’ sheap! two for five!”—they
    settled back in their chairs and plunged again into the outside
    thoroughfare.

  <p>
    Mr. Douglass, looking up a little absent-mindedly, saw a sign which
    he read thus, “Dancing-girl of Damascus now dancing—600 years old.”
    Startled by this marvel, even in that land of enchantment, he turned
    his head and found that the 600 years referred to the city rather
    than to the dancer.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">63</span></p>

  <p>“Where would you like to stop now, sir?” asked the guide.</p>

  <p>
    “Suppose we go to Cairo Street, Philip?” said Mr. Douglass. “We can
    see camels and donkeys and queer buildings without number; and it is
    said to be a very interesting, genuine exhibit.”
  </p>

  <p>
    They entered the long narrow passage, leaving their chairs outside.
    Philip’s camera was again declared contraband of war, and held in
    bondage while he “interviewed” the official photographer of the
    street. He soon returned with the “open sesame” (price $1.00)—another
    ticket to tie to the camera handle; and they all went forward to view
    the glories of Cairo.

    <div class="caption">THE “DONKEY-BOYS.”</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    It was the liveliest, jolliest place they had yet entered. Donkeys
    ridden by little boys or little girls came bumping along amid the
    laughter of the scattering crowd; sneering camels lurched in zigzag
    courses, carrying giggling girls or grinning men. The camel-riders
    had the effect of bowing graciously to the crowd, and hung on
    desperately to the loops of the saddles, as if they were upon
    bucking broncos. But the most amusing part of camel-riding was the
    dismounting. The camels went down bows-on at first, and then lowered
    the hind legs. This process was always sure to bring out little
    shrieks of dismay from the women, and a burst of laughter from the
    onlookers.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">64</span></p>

  <p>
    Philip’s camera was agog with eagerness. He captured a view or two
    of the picturesque “donkey-boys”—who were stalwart grown men; but
    when he saw the great nodding camels docilely following their tiny
    boy-leaders, he made up his mind that the camel was his favorite
    subject.
  </p>

  <div class="figleft">
    <a id="i_077"><img src="images/i_077.jpg" width="150" height="242" alt="" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>
    He particularly desired to secure a view of the dismounting. Seeing a
    flight of steps that would enable him to overlook this scene, he put
    his camera under his arm and wormed his way through the crowd until
    he had secured an excellent place on an upper step.
  </p>

  <p>
    From here, by raising the camera high in air, he took a picture over
    the heads of the spectators, and then rejoined Mr. Douglass and
    Harry, who were waiting for him across the street near some of the
    bazaars for the sale of curiosities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Harry, while waiting, had produced his sketch-book, and made a hasty
    outline of a street-sweeper who, in turban and baggy trousers, was
    plying a most prosaic broom and dust-pan.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just above their heads they read a sign advertising an Arab
    card-writer, and when Philip returned they began a search for this
    gentleman, who promised a card in English and Arabic for five cents.
    It proved to be a difficult matter to find him. Inquiring upon one
    side of the street, they were directed to the other; and, repeating
    the question there, were politely sent back again; but soon they
    caught sight of a ring of people near the middle of the street,
    gazing down toward the pavement, and there, within, sat the writer.
  </p>

  <div class="figright">
    <a id="i_077a"><img src="images/i_077a.jpg" width="350" height="226" alt="" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>
    Philip pressed forward with a slip torn from his note-book, on which
    he had written plainly, “Philip Rodman,” putting below, “Please write
    this name in English and Arabic.”
  </p>

  <p>
    When his turn came, the sharp-featured little writer raised his
    fezzed head from gazing down upon the inlaid box which served him as
    a desk, and said:
  </p>

  <p>“You want-a me to write for you—yes?”</p>

  <p>“Yes, please,” Philip answered.</p>

  <p>So the scribe began, like a school-boy reciting his lesson:</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">65</span></p>

  <p>
    “Pheelipe. P, h, i, l, i, and p. Pheelipe. Rodermahn—I write him
    pretty, in Engleesh, yes; and I vill shade him, yes. R, a capeetal R,
    o, d, m, a, n. Pheelipe Rodermahn. There. Now, what ceety?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Now write it in Arabic, please,” said Philip, a little embarrassed
    by the crowd.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Pretty soon; in a meenute. You vait. First, what ceety,—vere you
    leeve?”
  </p>

    <div class="caption">IN CAIRO STREET.</div>

  <p>“New York,” Philip answered.</p>

  <p>
    “All right, all right; I make him ver’ preety. N, big N, e, w; Y, a
    big Y, o, and r, and k. There. Now I write you my own <em>beautiful</em>
    name. See!” and he added his own name with rapid strokes.
  </p>

  <p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Très bien!</i>” said Harry, jokingly.</p>

  <p>
    “Aha, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vous parlez Français</i>, eh? <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Et moi, aussi! Où apprenez-vous le
    Français?</i>”
  </p>

  <p>
    “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À Paris</i>,” said Harry, a little taken aback. “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je le parle un peu, mais je le comprend.</i>”
  </p>

  <p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah, ça va bien! Regardez; voici l’Arabique.</i>”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">66</span></p>

  <p>
    Turning the card over, the accomplished scribe traced the graceful
    curves, and handed Philip the card, saying, “I can write heem as well
    in four language.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Philip put down two nickels, and waved his hand when the man looked
    up in surprise.
  </p>

  <p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah, merci, m’sieu! Je vous remercie, et—au revoir!</i>”</p>

  <p>
    “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir!</i>” said Harry; and the three moved away with very kindly
    feelings toward the clever card-writer.
  </p>

  <p>
    As they turned toward the further end of the street, an elderly
    Arab passed them with a stony glare, repeating aloud over and over,
    “Hello! How-de-do! <em>Good</em>-morning! Hello! How-de-do! <em>Good</em>-morning!”
    but paying no attention whatever to any one in particular.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Now Philip says he’d like to go into the Soudanese Exhibit,” said
    Mr.<span class="pagenum">67</span> Douglass, looking at a little plan of the Plaisance. He was
    a systematic traveler, and always secured a map or plan of each
    place he visited. They turned into a small inclosure, after buying
    tickets and seeing them dropped into a battered black tin box (the
    regular preliminary to all the shows), and found themselves the only
    visitors in a canvas tent that sheltered a board platform raised a
    little above the ground. On the platform sat two men and a woman; and
    about the tent was playing a lively little Soudanese baby—advertised
    outside as the “Dancing-baby only eighteen months old!”
  </p>

  <div class="figright">
    <a id="i_080"><img src="images/i_080.jpg" width="300" height="345" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">THE FLOWER-GIRL.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    It was to photograph the baby that Philip had come in. But no sooner
    did the awful black box appear than there was a hubbub.
  </p>

  <p>“No, no!” shrieked the mother, fiercely.</p>

  <p>
    “Nah, nah!” cried the men; and Philip, supposing that he had
    threatened to interfere with some of their religious scruples,
    dejectedly lowered his box. But, as they turned away, our innocent
    travelers quickly had their eyes opened to the true situation.
  </p>

  <p>
    “One dollar, one dollar!” cried one of the men, following them up.
    He was tastefully attired in a fez, a long white burnoose (a garment
    exactly like a nightgown), and red slippers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then Harry, who had traveled abroad, felt equal to the situation. He
    wheeled around with a look of grieved surprise.
  </p>

  <p>
    “One dollar?” he exclaimed. “Oh, no, no. Twenty-five cents. One
    quarter.”
  </p>

  <p>“No, no. One dollar!” spoke the Soudanese.</p>

  <p>
    “One quarter,” insisted the American boy, “or fifty cents for the
    whole family”; and he waved his arms as if amazed at his own lavish
    generosity.
  </p>

  <p>“No. Fifty cent for the baby,” suggested the dark dickerer.</p>

  <p>
    “Twenty-five in here, fifty if you will take her into the sunshine.
    Come along,” said Harry, starting for the door.
  </p>

  <p>
    “All-a right!” and the Soudanese made the bargain. For the
    half-dollar, he conducted the baby to a good light, and let her be
    taken.
  </p>

  <p>
    This little tot was as bright as a new cowrie-shell; she had around
    her waist a dozen rows of tiny dry hoofs taken from some small
    animal, and<span class="pagenum">68</span> these gave her great delight. She crowed and jumped, and
    rattled at every motion.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Why, a rattlesnake would be scared to death at such a baby!” said
    Harry; “and her mother couldn’t lose her if she tried. But she
    couldn’t go to church with that thing on—not if she was restless!”
  </p>

  <p>
    After taking one more picture, the portrait of an Egyptian
    flower-girl who wandered into the tent, and whose costume, if not
    her face, was her fortune (at a quarter for every photograph), the
    explorers waved a final good-by to the rattling baby and turned again
    into Cairo Street.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before an attentive circle, just outside the inclosure, an Arab was
    beginning a performance of trained animals—at least he had a kid
    poised on a pedestal, and a monkey making ready to ride.
  </p>

  <p>
    Philip pressed forward to the inner edge of the ring, and leveled the
    box. He snapped the shutter. Catching the noise, the animal-trainer
    pulled the kid suddenly down and shook his head with a triumphant
    grin. Philip moved away, while the bystanders laughed.
  </p>

  <p>
    “‘He laughs best who laughs last,’” thought Philip to himself, as he
    wound up the exposed film and rejoined his companions.

    Douglass had trouble in making out the German names of dishes on the
    bill of fare, and he asked Harry, the traveled member of the party,
    to read it for him. To his great admiration, the boy translated the

    and, putting down the bill of fare, he showed Mr. Douglass that it
    had an English translation just opposite the German.
  </p>

  <p>
    “That is certainly the best system for teaching foreign languages I
    have seen,” Mr. Douglass agreed. “I begin to understand it myself.”
  </p>

  <p>
    After finishing what they could eat,—there was much that they were
    compelled to abandon,—they sat a few moments over their small cups
    of coffee, listening to a fine band that played airs from the opera
    “Carmen.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “When we leave here,” said Harry, “suppose we go up in the Ferris
    Wheel? That gives a splendid view of the whole region, and several
    people have told me it is one of the best things in the Fair.”
  </p>

  <p>“Can I take photographs from it?” asked the camera-bearer.</p>

  <p>“We will ask,” Mr. Douglass replied.</p>

  <p>
    They were told at the office that they would be permitted to
    take pictures upon signing a statement that they were not for
    publication.<span class="pagenum">72</span> Philip, however, asked for and obtained a suspension
    of this condition; and, armed with the permit, they took their place
    opposite a little door that separated them from the enormous iron
    spider-web.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a few minutes the Wheel came slowly to rest, a sliding door was
    opened, and they entered one of the small cars, of which the Wheel
    carried some forty suspended within the two great rims. The door was
    shut, and up they flew, as if in a balloon.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">OLD VIENNA.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    At first they went completely around without stopping. As they
    mounted into the air, over two hundred feet, the whole region was
    mapped out about them. They saw the Fair, the lake, Chicago in the
    distance,—beneath a veil of hazy smoke,—the Midway, a long white
    road dotted with its puppet sight-seers. Old Vienna, where they had
    lunched, dwindled into a toy village.
  </p>

  <p>
    Philip took several views, but most of them were during the second
    trip, for then they stopped every now and then to let off and take on
    passengers, three cars being emptied at a time and at once refilled.
    He took a view from the Wheel, and a view looking across the Wheel
    inside.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was nothing unpleasant in going up or coming down; but when the
    Wheel stopped, one had the awful thought that something might give<span class="pagenum">73</span>
    way. Now and then came a slight creak or crumble, as if some part
    was a little strained; but it need not be said that the Wheel did
    not come down. Neither did any of the cars turn heels over head—that
    is, floor over roof—as Philip for a moment dreaded. In talking it
    over afterward, Harry said that his notion was that perhaps the Wheel
    might stop and leave them up there, and he wondered how they would
    get down. They came out much gratified with their upward flight, and
    spoke heartily in praise of the perfect engineering skill shown in
    the Wheel’s construction and operation.
  </p>

  <p>
    “And do you know, boys,” said Mr. Douglass, “the Wheel came here in
    sections and was put together for the first time on these grounds? It
    has run smoothly and safely ever since, and is in every way just what
    its designer meant it to be. He is still a young man, and may some
    day do even more wonderful things. It is well not to forget that the
    most difficult engineering feats are not always the ones that seem
    most wonderful to the public.”
  </p>

    <div class="caption">GOING INTO THE CARS OF THE FERRIS WHEEL.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    “Say,” Harry cried out suddenly, pointing southward, “there’s
    something that looks as if it would be good fun.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Philip and Mr. Douglass turned, and saw what looked like an
    old-fashioned “double-ripper”—a sleigh shooting down and up a long
    toboggan-slide.<span class="pagenum">74</span> As they had no objection to trying it “for the fun
    of the thing,” they went over and bought tickets for ten cents,
    entitling them to seats in the sled.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_087"><img src="images/i_087.jpg" width="600" height="495" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">FROM THE FERRIS WHEEL—LOOKING EAST.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Once or twice it dashed past them; then it came to a halt, and they
    all scrambled in, taking their places in the seats, which held three
    apiece. Then a gong rang, and they were off! Starting slowly, the
    sledge gradually increased its speed until it met an incline, up
    which it went more slowly, and would have stopped except that a
    cable gripped it and hauled it to the top of the hill. Then, again
    released, the sledge sped down with great rapidity, but was checked
    by a curve around which it whirled “like all possessed,” as a
    fidgety old lady exclaimed; and indeed the passengers clung tightly
    to the sides. Around they went again and again, repeating the same
    experiences until the fourth time, when the car was stopped.
  </p>

  <p>One man, who sat next to Philip, said: “Where you from?”</p>

  <p>“New York,” Philip answered.</p>

  <p>
    “I from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis!” said the man triumphantly, evidently meaning to
    call attention to the wonderful fact that the world was small, after
    all. As they rounded the bend for the third time, the German said:
  </p>

  <p>“I lose my vife!”</p>

  <p>“I’m sorry,” said Philip, sympathetically.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">75</span></p>

  <p>
    “Oh, dat’s all right,” said his talkative companion. “I get her again
    ven ve stop. She got on other sled. I could not for the crowd. But
    she vill vait for me; she vill not run avay. She is too good for me,
    anyhow!”
  </p>

  <p>
    Philip was relieved that the trouble was not more serious, and after
    they left the car, the triumphant German pointed to his faithful
    spouse, saying: “See! I tol’ you!”
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_088"><img src="images/i_088.jpg" width="600" height="466" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">FROM THE FERRIS WHEEL—LOOKING WEST.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    After taking a snap-shot at the moving sled, they left the building,
    securing at the exit a handful of snow, which was, as the exhibitor
    claimed, real snow. But he also said it was a souvenir; and as a
    souvenir it was a failure, unless it was kept in a bottle, for it
    melted after the manner of all well-conducted snow elsewhere than on
    high mountain-peaks.
  </p>

  <p>
    The “Moorish Palace” received their attention next. Upon entering
    they found themselves in what they considered a very ordinary show.
    It was a large room having tables and chairs, beer and tobacco-smoke,
    and a stage where a variety performance took place.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two young men, in evening dress, were carrying on a dialogue that
    Harry said was perhaps the most genuine antique in the Plaisance.
    This dialogue, varied by fair handsprings, lasted longer than the
    boys cared to stay; so they wandered further into the Moorish
    mysteries. Groups and<span class="pagenum">76</span> figures in wax occupied a large part of the
    second floor, but the only interesting object the boys saw was a
    printed sign requesting visitors not to talk to the wax figures. Mr.
    Douglass’s book had informed him that there was a “maze” of mirrors
    well worth seeing, but in finding this exhibit the party displayed
    more ingenuity than was shown in the maze itself. “Dime museum” was
    the boys’ well-considered verdict. Turning away, they were attracted
    by the cry: “Do not fail to see the performance in the great Moorish
    theater!” Always willing to oblige, the party mustered three dimes,
    received tickets, and entered at this new door.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Well, well!” said Mr. Douglass, as he reached the edge of a balcony
    from which he could look upon the performance. The boys walked
    forward, supposing that he was expressing surprise. And so he was.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_089"><img src="images/i_089.jpg" width="600" height="669" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">A VIEW THROUGH THE FERRIS WHEEL.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    They had paid another admission fee all round for the privilege of
    entering the gallery of the same room from which they had departed
    in disgust only a few minutes before. They were grieved rather than
    angry, and explained their plight to the ticket-seller. He did not
    let the matter weigh upon his spirits to any extent, nor did he seem
    much surprised.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">77</span></p>

  <p>
    “Boys,” said Mr. Douglass, as they descended the dusty stairs, “I
    think that’s enough of a maze for me.”
  </p>

  <p>
    When once more in the roadway, they agreed to separate. Mr. Douglass
    preferred to go back to the Fair; Philip wished to try for a few more
    photographs, and Harry still kept his faith in the Wild Animal Show.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_090"><img src="images/i_090.jpg" width="600" height="473" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">LOOKING UP AT THE FERRIS WHEEL.</div>
  </div>

  <p>So Philip and Mr. Douglass left him, and Harry walked toward the show.</p>

  <p>
    “Oh, I like the whole business; don’t you?” he heard a woman say to a
    friend; and he was willing to agree so far, if he might except that
    Moorish maze.
  </p>

  <p>
    He found a large crowd pressing toward the Animal exhibit, and,
    buying a ticket at the door, was soon ushered into a very large
    amphitheater surrounding a circus-ring on a raised platform. Above
    the ring was a covered cage. Harry made his way toward a number of
    unoccupied seats, and was surprised that these were so empty while
    the others were so crowded.
  </p>

  <p>
    A little boy, coming to collect the tickets, announced: “You can stay
    here if you like; but you won’t see nothing much, for the animals
    sit around here, and you’ll have to look over ’em.” So Harry took
    a better place, near two German gentlemen, one of whom courteously
    handed him a program, for which there was an extra charge made.
  </p>


  <div class="figcenter">
    <span class="pagenum">78</span>
    <a id="i_091"><img src="images/i_091.jpg" width="600" height="471" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">A VIEW TAKEN AT FULL SPEED ON THE ICE RAILWAY.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    A scarlet-coated band filled the air with melody, and the show
    began, introduced by a really blood-curdling roar, such as a healthy
    and hungry lion gives when he wishes to make an impression. The
    amphitheater was as full of people as if it had been the only
    exhibition given that afternoon in Chicago. A baby elephant lumbered
    in, followed by a large hound and two ponies, and these animals went
    through a clever performance of marching, wheeling, waltzing, and
    posing under the direction of a graceful young girl dressed in a
    close-fitting purple velvet jacket, trousers, and military boots.
    They were excellently managed, and performed cleverly.
  </p>

  <p>
    A wild boar came next,—an ugly-faced fellow,—and was put through his
    feats of hurdle-racing and riding a chariot drawn by another boar. He
    failed at two hurdles out of three, knocking them over; but was made
    by the clown, his trainer, to repeat the trick successfully, amid
    applause. Once the clown made the boar sit down on a high tub, and
    then cocked a white hat over the animal’s ear, giving him a comical
    appearance.
  </p>

  <p>
    The succeeding performance was one of the cleverest. A ring-master
    came in, bringing a small pony whose neck was covered by a thick
    white pad, and who carried a flat saddle upon his back. Afterward
    entered a<span class="pagenum">79</span> lithe, tawny lioness, who ran cat-like around the ring,
    and another enormous hound who did little, but was probably an
    important part of the show.
  </p>

  <div class="figright">
    <a id="i_092"><img src="images/i_092.jpg" width="400" height="196" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">A SLEEPING LIONESS.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The lioness leaped upon a high platform, and as the pony came around
    the ring sprang upon his back just as a circus-rider does. Again the
    lioness leaped from the pony to another platform higher in the air,
    and awaited the pony’s second circuit. It was very exciting to Harry,
    for the lioness seemed anything but cowed—snarling, raising her
    whiskers, and showing much spirit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Harry made up his mind that the hound was brought in as a sort of
    watch-dog, in case the lioness should show more spirit than the
    circus-performance demanded; and this idea was strengthened by the
    presence of these great dogs in nearly every act—but usually as very
    minor performers.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the lioness had loped down the sloping passage leading from the
    ring, attendants came in and removed the carpets and mats used in the
    circus-performance. They returned with little wooden shelves arranged
    to hook upon the bars around the great circular cage, and put these
    in place. Then the lion-tamer entered, not in tights, spangles,
    armor, or tinsel, but in a dark business-suit that would not have
    attracted attention in the street.
  </p>

  <p>
    After him came in a “happy family,” as it used to be called in the
    Barnum days; but not the sort of happy family that would be welcome
    if it should drop in to spend the evening. First came the dogs, then
    three bears, two black and one a polar bear, then lions, Bengal
    tigers, until each of the many little shelves had its occupant.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_092a"><img src="images/i_092a.jpg" width="600" height="200" alt="" /></a>

  <div class="figleft">
    <a id="i_093"><img src="images/i_093.jpg" width="300" height="442" alt="" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>
    These animals were admirably trained, and went through a variety of
    clever performances. One little black bear—just the sort of little
    fellow you would expect to see robbing bees of honey, or stealing a
    squealing little porker from a sty—was led out and invited to show
    the ladies and gentlemen how well he could walk on a great, blue,
    rolling ball. As he went forward to begin the act, his lounging
    gait set all the spectators to laughing, and his whole performance
    was equally funny, excellently as it was done. When through, he was
    rewarded by a lump of sugar produced from the ring-master’s coat-tail
    pocket. The same bear also walked the “tight-rope” along a thick bar
    of wood.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile the polar bear acted as a clown. He seemed to find
    something very interesting about one of the big hounds. During each
    act, Mr. Polar Bear would leave his place and snuff around Mr. Dog’s
    ears, and paw his neck with the great sharp claws necessary to one
    who walks much on icebergs and other slippery places. At one time,
    late in the performance, the bear seemed to conclude that the dog was
    good to eat, and began to take him in head first. But here the dog’s
    patience gave out, and he howled a gentle protest that sent the polar
    bear back to his place.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the little black bear had finished his second act, the
    ring-master patted him upon the head with a pleasant touch of
    approval that was kindly and encouraging.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_093a"><img src="images/i_093a.jpg" width="700" height="201" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">YOUNG LION ASLEEP.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum">81</span></p>

  <p>
    Then the animals changed about: the bear going back to his place,
    and the Bengal tigers slouching into the ring. A see-saw was put
    up, and, with a tiger on each end, was rocked to and fro by another
    black bear—one that had a peculiar white crescent upon his breast.
    After this the whole company ranged themselves, standing, in a ring,
    and the big dogs leaped over their backs just as circus-riders leap
    hurdles.
  </p>

  <p>
    A chariot came rolling in, a number of the attendants followed, and
    two tigers were yoked up as if each were “the patient ox obedient to
    the goad.”
  </p>

  <div class="figright">
    <a id="i_094"><img src="images/i_094.jpg" width="500" height="590" alt="" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>
    The biggest lion, draped in a scarlet cloak and crowned, mounted the
    chariot, while two hounds rested their fore legs upon the back of the
    chariot, and around the ring went the gorgeous procession—an animal
    Emperor making a triumphal procession.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another pyramid of animals was formed, and then all, set free, went
    rolling and tumbling about the arena, as their trainer stood among
    them giving out sugar.
  </p>

  <p>
    No exhibition of animal-training could have been better, and Harry
    left the building well satisfied with his afternoon at the Animal
    show.
  </p>

  <p>
    Coming out into the Plaisance road once more, Harry started to walk
    back to the hotel. He had enjoyed the rolling-chair in the morning,
    but felt freer to go where he chose when he was by himself and on
    foot. He did not intend to see any more sights than he could help,
    but the boy had to keep his eyes open to see where he went, and so
    long as he did not shut his eyes, sights had to be looked at.
  </p>

  <p>
    In passing the Children’s Building, he noticed carefully where it
    was, as he intended to come back to it soon; then he walked through
    the “Puck”<span class="pagenum">82</span> Building, noticing the color-printing, and the pretty
    photograph of a child dressed as “Puck,” and passed thence across a
    bridge to the quiet wooded island. His eyes were rested by the soft
    green tints, and the quiet was very refreshing after the bustle and
    confusion of the Plaisance. All about were little fairy lamps of
    different colored glass, arranged in preparation for an illumination
    of the island that night.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">

  </div>

  <p>
    Harry wandered on without attending strictly to his course, and
    consequently found himself in the middle of the island without any
    means of crossing to the Manufactures Building. As he wished to walk
    the length of that building on his way home, he rather reluctantly
    retraced his weary way to the bridge leading to the Fisheries
    Building. But this mistake enabled him to warn another party of
    visitors against the same error, and they followed him over the two
    bridges to the Manufactures Building.
  </p>

  <div class="figleft">
    <a id="i_095b"><img src="images/i_095b.jpg" width="200" height="113" alt="" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>
    He was too tired to look at exhibits, and walked doggedly down the
    long aisle until he came out upon the great Court of Honor. Here he
    rested a little while, feeling rather dazed, and then walked by the
    Administration Building in company with many out-going parties quite
    as weary as he.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">83</span></p>
  <div class="figright">

  <p>
    A soldier in flaming regimentals passed, carrying a baby in his
    arms, while the unwarlike wife followed at his side, supporting the
    officer’s heavy sword. This odd exchange of duties was the last thing
    Harry noticed before he left the gates.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mr. Douglass came home, and reported that he had spent most of the
    afternoon in examining the decorations and groups upon the outside
    of the larger buildings, particularly those upon the Administration
    Building, as he wished to write some account of it to a friend
    interested in decorative work.
  </p>

  <p>
    As to Philip, he resolutely refused to tell the others all about his
    afternoon except so far as this. He said, “I had some trouble about
    my camera, and it took me all the afternoon to straighten it out.”
  </p>

  <p>Later, his little adventure came out, and shall be told.</p>

    “<span class="smcap">In</span> the absence of any special instructions from your father, Harry,”
    said Mr. Douglass, as they walked over toward the entrance of the
    Fair Grounds on the following morning, “I have so far let you have
    your own way. I think that Mr. Blake perhaps forgot that his letter
    of instructions would not arrive at Chicago until we had been here at
    least a week.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Now that we have a general idea of the display, of the grounds and
    their arrangement, I think it would be wise to go at them a little
    more systematically. What do you think?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I should like that better,” said Philip. “I feel all the time that
    we are missing some good things, and seeing poorer ones twice over.
    Don’t you, Harry?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I suppose so,” Harry answered slowly; “but I find it all too much
    for me. I find myself thinking more of the people I see than of the
    show.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Let us go and see some one part more especially,” Mr. Douglass
    suggested; “some part that we know less about than we have learned
    of the larger buildings. How would you like to look at some of the
    larger State buildings?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I’d like it,” Harry agreed. “But I’ll tell you what, while Philip
    was using his camera yesterday I wanted one ‘like sixty.’ Why can’t I
    hire one?”
  </p>

  <p>“You can,” the tutor answered. “Where do we go to get it, Philip?”</p>

    “To the free dark-rooms back of the Horticultural. We can walk there:
    it isn’t far from where we usually go in; or, if you want to go in a
    new way, we can keep outside until we get to the proper entrance.”
  </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    All three were willing; and, keeping outside of the high board fence
    topped with several lines of barbed wire, they walked on for two
    or three blocks above the main entrance. The street was lined by
    booths for the sale of the omnipresent souvenirs—glass paper-weights,
    watch-charms, canes, lockets, and every sort of cheap knickknack; and
    these booths were elbowed by temporary shops and stands made to serve
    for restaurants, fruit-stands, shooting-galleries, tintype-galleries,
    cake-kitchens,—all the cheap-John establishments that could find room
    to claim a nickel from the passers-by.
  </p>

  <p>
    Coming to the entrance they sought, they met a young man in a blue
    uniform and cap showing that he was an agent of the Photographic
    Department. Harry paid him two dollars, and received a “hand-camera
    permit, good for that day only,” the date being stamped on it in
    green ink. They found themselves, after passing the gates, not far
    from the photographic rooms. Here Harry secured a small, easily
    handled kodak, upon which Mr. Douglass made a deposit of ten dollars.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Now,” said Harry, “I’ll show you how cameras are handled by
    experts.”
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">87</span></p>

  <p>
    “But remember,” the tutor reminded him, “that you are here to-day
    with the intention of going through some State buildings at least.
    Don’t think mainly of taking snap-shots.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Oh, I won’t,” Harry replied, more seriously; “I only mean to take
    pictures of the groups of people here and there—especially the
    children. Children are always so interesting when they are at a place
    like this.”
  </p>

  <p>Mr. Douglass smiled at the boy’s grown-up airs, but said nothing more.</p>

  <p>
    “Come,” said Philip, “I want to go over to the Manufactures Building.
    I saw in my magazine that one could register there, and I’m going to
    do it. Besides, I haven’t been in the galleries of that building yet,
    and I’d like to go. We won’t stay long, and we can meet there if we
    should separate for a while.”
  </p>

  <p>
    They entered by the north door, climbed into the gallery, and found
    that some of the periodicals had arranged tasteful little rooms
    for the accommodation of the public. People entered these small
    compartments with a homelike feeling that was very pleasant to see.
    There were tables and chairs, books for the registry of visitors, and
    glass cases showing magazine- and book-work in full detail, besides
    many other things connected more or less directly with the subjects
    of the books and articles published. But, intending to return again,
    the boys did not linger over the exhibits, pausing only long enough
    to register their names. Here Mr. Douglass remained to talk to one of
    the attendants, as he expected some letters to be addressed to him in
    care of that exhibit, and the boys started together for the National
    and State buildings.
  </p>

  <p>
    These filled a large part of the grounds around the great art
    galleries.
  </p>

  <p>
    Their first visit was to the house devoted to Great Britain. They
    marched boldly up to the door, opened it, and stepped inside.
  </p>

  <p>
    A guard came forward and politely told them that on this morning the
    building was open only on presentation of a card. The boys turned
    to go out, but one of the gentlemen in charge—a handsome young
    Englishman—courteously invited them to go through the rooms. They
    gladly accepted his invitation and guidance.
  </p>

  <p>
    “This,” he told the young Americans, so politely that for the moment
    they almost regretted the famous “tea-party” in Boston harbor,—“is
    called Victoria House by the Queen’s own wish. It represents a
    manor-house of the Tudor period, of about Queen Elizabeth’s time;
    but was made by a Chicago firm.” Then he went on to call their
    attention to the fine ceilings, fireplaces, staircases, and inlaid
    cabinets; and the boys found the house full of richly carved woodwork
    and furniture. Of the chairs, one was a model of that in which King
    Charles sat during his trial in Westminster<span class="pagenum">88</span> Hall, and others were
    quite as well worth attention, among them being chairs designed for
    the use of Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">VICTORIA HOUSE.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Our sturdy young Americans gazed with becoming reverence upon all
    this elegance and grandeur, took a few notes of what they had seen,
    and walked down the steps much gratified by the attention shown them.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Where next?” said Harry, at the same time taking a deft snap-shot at
    some little folks in the road before the door.
  </p>

  <p>“Germany comes next,” answered Philip, holding up a fluttering map.</p>

  <p>“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sprechen Sie deutsch</span>?” said Harry. “If you do, come along.”</p>

  <p>
    Entering the imposing German Building, they found at last some of the
    foreigners as to whom they had been inquiring. No sooner were they
    inside the door than guttural accents assured them that there were
    foreigners at the great World’s Fair. The hallway was full of German
    publications, and in a lower story were many religious figures,
    modeled life-size and colored. Taking a stairway to the right, the
    boys came to a lofty mechanical clock, called a “Passion Play Clock,”
    because figures, moved by machinery, went through a representation of
    the crucifixion. They heard a woman say, “Oh, I wish it was going!
    Don’t you?” Then they descended the stairs again, and, returning to
    the main hall, they noticed a very beautiful stained-glass window<span class="pagenum">89</span> at
    the further end. The middle panel showed Christ walking on the water,
    and those above and below contained modern steamships. A placard
    stated that the window was to be presented to the Naval Academy at
    Annapolis.
  </p>

  <p>
    Coming out, they were met by a puzzled woman, who inquired in a dazed
    way:
  </p>

  <p>“Where is that Anthropo—I don’t know the name?”</p>

  <p>
    “’Way down at the other end, madam,” answered Philip, politely
    raising his cap. To which the woman responded despairingly, “Oh, my!”
    and wandered off.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">INDIA HOUSE.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    “They never get much beyond ‘Anthropo,’” said Harry; “and I don’t
    blame them. I heard one of the guides the other day confidently call
    it ‘Anthro-polo-logical’ and look proud. But this isn’t photography,”
    and he turned his back to the sun and held his camera in readiness.
    Snap! went the shutter, and then they walked on.
  </p>

  <p>“What did you take?” Philip asked.</p>

  <p>
    “I’m not telling,” said Harry, slyly. “I may be new at this business,
    but at least I know enough to keep dark until the negative is
    developed. ‘Don’t count your negatives before they’re developed’ is
    my motto as an amateur photographer!”
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">90</span></p>

  <p>
    “Here’s the French Building,” said Philip; “and isn’t it French,
    though? See the green grass, trees, and fountain in the middle. Let’s
    go in and see it. It is sure to be good.”
  </p>

  <p>
    They found the French Building, as Philip expected, both artistic
    and interesting. There was an exhibit of transparent photographs on
    glass, explaining the method of measuring and describing criminals
    so that they may be always identified after being once in the hands
    of the police. Here was a panel devoted wholly to queer noses;
    next came one upon eyes, or chins, or foreheads, each with a line
    of explanation in French, which Harry translated. Then there was a
    wax figure before a camera, giving a vivid idea of the way these
    photographs were secured. A camera upon a very high tripod stood
    over another figure representing a body found dead—to explain how a
    picture-record is made of such cases.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">THE MASSACHUSETTS STATE BUILDING.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    There were specimens of the work of invalids, probably hospital
    patients, and around another part of the building were large
    paintings showing views of city squares and streets. The whole
    building was a proof of the skill of the French in arranging exhibits
    both sensibly and artistically, so that they would be both easy to
    view and pleasant to behold.
  </p>

  <p>
    A room devoted to relics of Lafayette was marked “Closed,” for which<span class="pagenum">91</span>
    the boys were sorry. They gave the French-Building a good mark in
    their note-books, and went away wishing they could give more time to
    it—the best proof of excellence.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">THE NEW YORK STATE BUILDING.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    They had intended next to see the Massachusetts house; but that also
    was not open, and they went by it on their way to New York’s mansion.
    Entering the great door, they noted first a pavement of tessellated
    blocks in which were set the signs of the zodiac in brass, finely
    modeled. Just before them they saw a long line of people crowding
    toward an enormous book that looked at least half a foot thick.
    A sign told them that they should register and have their names
    published in the “Daily Columbian,” the Fair paper, as a means of
    finding old acquaintances.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Here she goes!” cried Harry, as he took his place at the end of the
    queue, with Philip next. They could see the book from where they
    stood, and were much amused, though a little impatient, to see the
    painstaking efforts of country folks to write a creditable signature.
    One nice old lady dotted an “i” at least three times, and each time
    with due deliberation.
  </p>

  <p>
    As each visitor wrote name, temporary address, and home address,
    Harry had to wait several minutes for his turn. The result was
    that he scrawled his own name in a great hurry rather than keep
    others waiting. Then he<span class="pagenum">92</span> went half-way up the stairs, and took two
    short-time exposures toward the registering crowd. He doubted whether
    he could get anything worth preserving, but thought he would risk it.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">THE OHIO STATE BUILDING.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Then Philip and he went up-stairs to the banqueting-room—a stately
    apartment of which the boys were patriotically proud. Other rooms—one
    a colonial drawing-room with an old spinning-wheel, and an old cannon
    that was “fired at the births and deaths of members of the Rensselaer
    family,” and the other a more modern apartment—fittingly flanked the
    central apartment.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Well, we’ve got a splendid building,” remarked Philip, with a sense
    of satisfaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Yes, sir,” said Harry; “the old ‘Empire State’ always comes up
    smiling and takes a front seat right next to the band-wagon”; but he,
    too, was glad that his State was so creditably housed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pennsylvania, with a great “Keystone” on the front, was next in their
    pilgrimage; and here they found the genuine old Philadelphia Liberty
    Bell occupying the post of honor in the vestibule. Though “marred
    and bruised by many a thump,” the boys gazed upon it with genuine
    reverence. No<span class="pagenum">93</span> American boy could see it without something of the
    thrill in his veins that is the old bell’s due.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">THE CALIFORNIA STATE BUILDING.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    As they were gazing speechless upon it, a man behind them tried to
    express what all felt. He began, “That is the bell that—that rang,
    reverberating down through”—but here words failed him, and he passed
    silently on, a good though speechless patriot.
  </p>

  <p>
    Up-stairs they found tired Philadelphians in welcome quiet and
    seclusion. Even in the “Press-Correspondents’ Room” pens moved with
    Quaker-like dignity over the paper; indeed, one kindly old lady, on
    looking in at the door, remarked with sympathy; “Ah, yes, I see;
    people writing home to their friends!”
  </p>

  <p>
    In another up-stairs room were shown the original charter to William
    Penn,—a beautiful piece of antique writing,—and the Constitution of
    the State of Pennsylvania. Attached to the charter was a large wax
    seal, labeled over two hundred years old.
  </p>

  <p>“Pretty old wax, isn’t it?” said a quiet man near Harry.</p>

  <p>
    “Yes—waxing old,” the boy replied; but as the man gazed upon him
    in puzzled surprise, the boy moved off, rather ashamed of his
    forwardness.

  </div>

  <p>
    Going out, they noticed General Greene’s Revolutionary battle-flag,
    “baptized in the enemy’s smoke” at Bunker Hill. They visited the Ohio
    Building, also, and then walked toward the Art Gallery; and Harry
    tried a snap-shot again. This time it was at a chubby youngster who
    walked before them, carrying two packages of lunch, while his parents
    walked beside him. Winding up the film, the boys set forward at a
    rapid pace toward the California Building, pausing only to admire the
    great logs that formed a foundation to the structure the residents
    of the new State of Washington had proudly built. The California
    house was like the pictures of old Spanish Missions; it had an arched
    doorway, tiled roof, and fine tower.

  </div>

  <p>
    Though they spent a long time in this building, they were
    dissatisfied when they came away. There was “so much too much” to
    see. A relief-map of San Francisco, the knight “Sir Preserved
    Prunes,” the grizzly bear modeled from life, the piece of Laura
    Keene’s skirt showing dark stains where Lincoln’s bleeding head had
    rested, the exhibits of school-work,—drawing, modeled maps, and
    exercises,—and especially the stage-robbery exhibition made by the
    Wells Fargo Express Co., delighted both the boys. Then, too, there
    were paintings—one of Leland Stanford driving the last railroad-spike
    uniting the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific railroads, several
    of scenes in midwinter, showing trees in full leaf—in short, the
    California show sent two Eastern youngsters away full of hearty
    admiration for the young giant of the far Pacific coast.

    <div class="caption">THE ESKIMO AND THEIR DOGS.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    But by this time, useful knowledge was palling upon the two friends,
    and they gladly agreed to go back to the Eskimo village, which
    they had seen just as they turned south toward the Californian
    mission-house. They deposited two quarters, surrendered two<span class="pagenum">96</span> tickets,
    and walked into Greenland, only to be disappointed in the show. The
    sledge was upon wheels, which the boys hadn’t bargained for—though
    they hardly expected real ice-floes; and the row of bark huts were
    dark and commonplace. The natives themselves looked furry and real,
    and the reindeer and dogs were interesting.

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum">97</span></p>

  <p>
    Two of the Eskimos, one the well-known young “Prince,” held whips in
    their hands, ready to dislodge coins that might be set up as targets.
    Harry threw down a five-cent piece. The man stuck it up on edge, and
    then the whip-cracking resounded through the air. Judging by the
    number of shots they made unsuccessfully, Harry calculated that a
    five-dollar bill would have lasted them a month; but he didn’t try it.
  </p>

  <p>
    As they passed the building called “The Bureau of Public Comfort,”
    Harry tried a shot at some people who were eating lunch upon the
    grass.
  </p>

  <p>
    Later, he saw a young girl with a kodak making for the middle of one
    of the bridges, and walked after her, hoping to take a picture of her
    while she herself was snapping the button. As she leaned against the
    parapet and leveled the camera, Harry saw that he could get a pretty
    negative, and himself took the young photographer.
  </p>

  <p>
    On their way home the boys walked through Horticultural Hall, with
    its palm-trees, its flowers, and its lofty glass dome. By this time,
    however, they had learned to see without noticing, and they decided
    to come back some other day if they had time—a resolution already
    made in regard to perhaps one hundred and fifty equally absorbing
    collections.
  </p>

  <p>
    But there were several fine groups of sculpture. One the boys felt
    was full of sentiment and beauty; it was called “The Sleep of the
    Flowers,” and meant to be typical of autumn. The drooping of the
    vegetation and the lethargy of the coming winter were admirably
    translated into the action of the figures.
  </p>

  <p>“Philip,” said Harry, “we ought to see all these groups—everywhere.”</p>

  <p>
    “Harry,” replied his cousin, “we are doing our level best.” And,
    consoled by this thought, they rejoined Mr. Douglass and went home.

  <p>
    “<span class="smcap">Do</span> you think you are now capable of finding your way around without
    my help?” Mr. Douglass asked, in planning out the next day’s program.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Yes, sir,” Philip answered. “After all, the plan of the Fair is
    simple enough. It is only after one gets into the buildings that it
    becomes confusing. Several times I have intended to come out facing
    one building only to arrive at another. But I can soon set myself
    right again.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “How about the Intramural?” asked Harry, with affected anxiety. “Have
    you got that straight yet—or does it still run in a circle?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Come, Harry,” Mr. Douglass interposed; “Philip has learned better
    than to go wrong again. What shall you boys do to-day?—I am going to
    see the Government Building, unless you need me. I should like to see
    the Patent Office Exhibit.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I don’t know that we shall keep together all day, but Philip and
    I agreed to see the Children’s Building and the Woman’s Building,
    anyway. Besides, there is a life-saving drill on the lake front at
    half-past two, and perhaps we can get through in time to see that.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Promising to meet again for dinner, the boys left Mr. Douglass to
    finish breakfast leisurely, and set forth for the upper part of the
    grounds—the north end.
  </p>

  <p>
    As they went along, Philip drew out a little note-book and pencil,
    intending to note down the bits of talk he should overhear from
    passers-by. He seldom caught more than a scrap, but some of the
    fragments were<span class="pagenum">100</span> queer and suggestive. The first was the expression,
    “Perfectly magnificent!” Then came a heavy Western man, in a broad
    felt hat, eagerly telling two friends, “Why, if you was to spend
    only one second in front of each exhibit—” but they passed on. Then
    followed these:

  <p>“Think <em>I’ll</em> wander around this way?”</p>

  <p>“Ain’t that it, over there?”</p>

  <p>“Get the Orficial Cat-a-logue here.”</p>

  <p>
    Entering the Horticultural Building, intending only to walk through
    it, they heard these:
  </p>

  <p>“You been here, John?”</p>

  <p>“Wal, I was just a-lookin’ to see.”</p>

  <p>“Pennsylvania is along here, I guess.”</p>

  <p>
    They heard one man assert, “I don’t think that it is any good at
    all!” Whereupon his friend insisted, “Now, you just go along and see.”
  </p>

  <p>
    At a stand where a sharp young woman was selling “ever-pointed”
    pencils, a man inquired, “What’ll I do when the points are all gone?”
    To which the saleswoman scornfully retorted, “Isn’t two years long
    enough for only ten cents?—but even then you can get new ones at any
    stationer’s.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Coming out of the Horticultural, they caught the words, “The biggest<span class="pagenum">101</span>
    revolver in the world,” but never found out whether the speaker was
    referring to the Ferris Wheel, or to the Equator, or what.
  </p>

  <p>A woman passed by telling her husband about lunching.</p>

  <p>
    “Why, it scares them to death! Twenty-five cents was the cheapest on
    the bill of fare! But they took it, and they enjoyed it immensely!”
  </p>

  <p>
    “What do you suppose it was, Harry?” asked Philip, who liked to know
    all that went on.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Can’t imagine: possibly a watermelon,” Harry answered. “It couldn’t
    have been a turkey, judging by the prices we’ve seen.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Two young girls passed talking about the exhibits. Said one, “I’m
    not at all sensational over anything.” Whereupon the other told her,
    “Well, I like to get enthused over a thing like this.”
  </p>

  <p>
    By the side of the road was a closely cropped and velvety lawn, and
    over the lawn a patent sprinkler was propelling itself. The water in
    passing through the pipes set in motion wheels that propelled the
    little sprinkler slowly over the lawn so as to distribute the water
    evenly. It was a clever invention, and its utility was evident.
    Philip and Harry stopped to examine it, but Philip still kept his
    note-book in hand, and soon had jotted down these entries—speeches
    made at sight of the little motor:
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">102</span></p>

  <p>“Greatest thing I ever saw!”</p>

  <p>
    (“Evidently he did not come here by way of Niagara, as Phinney did,”
    remarked Harry.)
  </p>

  <p>“Runs itself—water does it! See?” said one.</p>

  <p>“Pretty—good—scheme!” exclaimed another.</p>

  <p>“Seen ’em before,” came from a third.</p>

  <p>“<em>Ain’t</em> that good?” observed a fourth.</p>

  <p>
    And then Harry and Philip went on; but they talked it over, and
    concluded that the little sprinkler was a rather independent machine
    to have set loose on a lawn. Sleeping dogs, and people dozing in
    hammocks, would have to take their chances.
  </p>

  <p>
    By this time they had reached the Children’s Building, and after
    admiring the frescoed medallions on the walls, showing children
    in various foreign costumes, they entered by the main door. First
    they went up-stairs to the second floor, as they had been invited
    by the lady in charge to come there at once. Unfortunately, she was
    not in; but there was plenty in the room to interest them. Upon the
    walls were large and small drawings, engravings, and photographs of
    writers known to children or especial favorites of young readers.
    They saw Miss Louisa M. Alcott (“Jo,” of “Little Women”), Hawthorne,
    Longfellow, Whittier, Mary Mapes Dodge, Thomas Bailey Aldrich (“Tom
    Bailey,” of “The Story of a Bad Boy”), Frank R. Stockton (whose
    “Jolly Fellowship” was a favorite book of Harry’s), Thomas Hughes
    (“Tom Brown at Oxford” and “Tom Brown at Rugby”), Holmes, Lowell—and
    ever so many more; but the author of “Billy Butts the Boy Detective”
    was left out without being missed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Along the middle of the library ran a glass case showing manuscripts,
    proof-sheets, and pictures that went to the making of <cite>“The Youth’s
    Companion”</cite> and <cite>“Harper’s Young People.”</cite> They had already seen a
    similar display of material for “<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas” in the publishers’
    rooms, where they had been the day before. It was a keen pleasure
    thus to see “how the wheels go round,” and to realize that the
    stories had an existence in pen and ink fresh from the authors’ hands.
  </p>

  <p>
    At one end of the room several bookcases contained books for or about
    children, from the earliest to the most modern. One book of the
    seventeenth century was bound in sheepskin and illustrated with odd
    little woodcuts to show different trades and pursuits. Near these
    older books were arranged autograph letters from Longfellow, Frank
    R. Stockton, Palmer Cox, Mrs. Cleveland, Colonel Higginson, Edward
    Eggleston, Bayard Taylor, George MacDonald, Christina G. Rossetti,
    Edward Everett Hale, Miss Alcott, Dr. Holmes, Helen Hunt Jackson, D.
    C. Gilman, and others, of whom<span class="pagenum">103</span> Philip and Harry knew more or less.
    In the library Philip also noticed a picture of Henry D. Thoreau, and
    reminiscent views of Walden Pond.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">THE LIBRARY: CHILDREN’S BUILDING.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Up-stairs, too, was Miss Huntington’s “Kitchen-Garden,” a school
    meant to teach the children of poor people in the city how to do well
    and cheerfully their household work. The little folks sang songs
    while making beds, setting tables, or sweeping rooms, and learned how
    to make and how to enjoy a neat home. In another corner was a school
    where deaf children were reciting as if they could hear, and were
    reading from the motions of their teacher’s lips what she said.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Philip and Harry went into this room, a big boy was writing upon
    the blackboard. They heard the teacher tell him to put down five
    words.
  </p>

  <p>
    He watched her lips while she spoke, and after some consideration
    wrote slowly the word “Money.” The teacher told him to go on;
    but, after a long pause, the boy said that he couldn’t think of
    any more. A little girl named Grace put up her hand, showing that
    she had thought of some; and the boy turned to her, very willing
    to be helped. So Grace took up his task, and wrote, “Truth, Care,
    Happy, Mirth”—quite a different kind of words from the sort the
    boy had chosen. To these short words the pupils<span class="pagenum">104</span> added endings, as
    “Truth-ful=truthful full of truth,” “Care-less=careless=without
    care,” defining the words thus made.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">TEACHING THE DEAF:<br />CHILDREN’S BUILDING.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Philip found it hard to remember that these scholars were deaf; but,
    as the two cousins were leaving the room, they saw at the door a
    little girl not nearly so far advanced. The teacher was showing her
    how to pronounce words, touching the child’s nose when she did not
    properly sound the letter “n,” and otherwise teaching her the very
    elements of speech. This sight made it easier for them to understand
    the difficulties the older pupils had overcome, and they went out
    with a better idea of the value of sound hearing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Around the top of one of the rooms was a strange checkered frieze,
    which, when closely examined, proved to be thousands of card
    temperance pledges signed by “children of all the world,” as the
    inscription told them. Being red and yellow, the cards made a pretty
    bit of decoration. Also on the second floor were a kindergarten
    class-room, with specimens of the work upon the walls; and a
    class-room for “sloyd,” or simple work in wood. But the latter was
    just then not in use, though there had been classes there not long
    before.
  </p>

  <p>
    As they were standing in a corner of the hall, looking at some
    pictures from children’s magazines, drawn by Reginald Birch, Alfred
    Brennan, and other favorite illustrators, they heard a little boy say:
  </p>

  <p>“Mama, come this way. I want to see the playthings!”</p>

  <p>
    “No; come on. I must see this room,” his mother answered; at which
    the boy whined out:
  </p>

  <p>“Oh-h! you won’t let me see a single thing!”</p>

  <p>
    This, if not exaggerated, was certainly a strong statement to be
    made by a small boy at a World’s Fair. To take a child into the Fair
    and not to let him see a single thing was not only cruel, but even
    remarkable. Probably the boy overstated it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Harry and Philip went up on the roof, but found nothing there, and
    then went down to the ground floor. Here, at one end, was the place
    where children were deposited while their parents enjoyed the sights
    at the Fair. One small boy was weeping bitterly, while his father and
    mother tried to console him. Philip stopped, and the father of the
    child said, “We were<span class="pagenum">105</span> going to leave him here, but he does not seem
    to like it”; so one boy was not checked.
  </p>

  <p>
    The boys would have been glad to see these little ones, but the
    windows and doors were crowded all the time they were in the
    building; so they gave up the attempt, and only glancing at the
    Illinois room, spent their last few minutes in watching the children
    who had come in to exercise.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">THE NURSERY: CHILDREN’S BUILDING.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The whole central portion down-stairs was fitted up as a gymnasium,
    and there was a director in attendance to show visiting children how
    to use the apparatus. There were children jumping, climbing, and
    swinging, and enjoying themselves keenly. It was open at certain
    hours every day, and was always filled with young athletes.

  <p>
    Feeling that they had now been through the Children’s Building, they
    stepped across to the adjoining exhibit, the Woman’s Building, but
    walked around it half-way, so as to enter at the main entrance. They
    found the building a larger one than they had expected, and spent
    more time there than they had thought necessary. Of course there were
    many things on which no self-respecting boys would waste time—things
    their sisters might understand, but which they saw nothing in. The
    embroideries, for instance,<span class="pagenum">107</span>
    were to the boys
    only pictures; they didn’t pretend to say which nation was entitled
    to the gold medal for needlework. Neither did they pause long before
    the dressmakers’ exhibits. But, still, they found enough in every
    direction to delay their departure, and it was time for lunch before
    they were ready to leave. They liked the frescos, particularly that
    showing the “Lady with the Lamp” among the sick soldiers.

  </div>

  <p>
    In the educational exhibit, they heard a little girl exclaim, “Those
    are mine!” pointing to some drawings; but they did not see much to
    interest them (in their fastidiousness) except a method of firing
    colored signal-rockets from guns or pistols; and when they heard a
    portly woman saying to her friend, “Now, as for me, I would line it
    with—” they began to rush past everything in the nature of dry goods.
    An embroidered curtain, showing a combat of dragons, detained Harry
    long enough for him to declare it “the most mixed up thing he ever
    saw, for he couldn’t untangle t’ other dragon from which dragon, and
    he didn’t believe the whole Board of Lady Managers could, either.”
  </p>

  <p>
    A case of dolls showing Dutch, Quaker, and other costumes, the boys
    were sure girls would like; and while standing beside it, they heard
    a woman say to her husband: “That doll is dressed the way women
    dressed when you and I were young.” It was a dress such as the boys
    had seen in pictures of war-times—about 1863.
  </p>

  <p>
    In one case was some needlework by Queen Victoria, but the ardent
    inhabitants of our great republic prevented the boys from seeing how
    deft royalty was with the needle.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Anyway,” said Harry, “she never sat in unwomanly rags plying her
    needle and thread.”
  </p>

  <p>
    In the art gallery of the Woman’s Building the boys noticed only a<span class="pagenum">108</span>
    few of the pictures; “Jean and Jacques,” by Marie Bashkirtseff, was
    one they particularly liked. It showed two little French boys going
    “unwillingly to school,” dressed in their black blouses. Another was
    a little girl playing hide-and-go-seek behind a low bush. She had a
    sweet little face and bewitching smile.
  </p>

  <p>
    They also liked the “Ethnographical Department,” where they found
    all sorts of weapons and utensils from Africa, collected by Mrs.
    French-Sheldon, the explorer. Harry didn’t altogether like the idea
    of a woman’s showing that she explored, just as if she was a Sir
    Samuel Baker with a great beard, and he consoled himself with the
    reflection that even Mrs. French-Sheldon probably couldn’t whittle a
    stick.
  </p>

  <div class="figleft">
    <a id="i_121"><img src="images/i_121.jpg" width="400" height="272" alt="" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>
    In the gallery were drawings and paintings, among them some by Queen
    Victoria and other noble amateurs. Harry, owing to the fact that the
    crowd usually remains below stairs, was able to critically examine
    the Queen’s sketches. The hind legs of one of her dog-drawings
    particularly delighted him, since they proved beyond question that
    there is no royal road to animal-drawing. Harry himself had often
    found the same trouble in drawing the same points, and a warm
    artistic sympathy welled up in his heart for the great Empress of
    India in her struggles to conquer animal-drawing. When, in the same
    gallery, he saw some drawings by Mary Hallock Foote, an artist
    whose works he admired, he believed that he would rather be a plain
    American who could draw than a crowned queen who did very well
    considering how busy she was with state matters.
  </p>

  <p>
    They glanced into the stately California room, upon the floor of
    which was a great grizzly-bear rug, and then made up their minds that
    it was time to be lunching if they intended to see the life-saving
    crew at work. But on their way out, they stopped long enough for
    Harry to have his name written by a woman card-writer, who used a
    pen set “skew-shaw” on its handle. She added his residence—the State
    only—and the date. It cost him five cents, but he felt that Philip
    was no longer one ahead of him.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">109</span></p>

  <p>
    Philip saw a machine marked “Music, Fortune, Weight,” with the usual
    request about dropping a nickel. He stood on the platform, and
    dropped the nickel. The machine played “The Sweet By and By,” and
    shoved out a ticket upon one side of which was stamped his weight,
    “95,” and upon the other was, “You will soon receive a fortune from
    across the sea.”
  </p>

  <p>
    They walked between the State buildings over toward the lake,
    intending to take lunch somewhere nearer the shore. When in front of
    Ohio’s Building, with its projecting portico, they stopped to look
    at the great statue in front. A woman’s figure upon a lofty pedestal
    raises her arms proudly as if to call the attention of all the world.
    Around the pedestal, like a row of bad boys sent to stand against the
    wall for whispering, are a ring of Ohio’s great men, including Grant,
    Garfield, and Stanton. In prominent letters around the pedestal are
    the words, “These are my jewels.” While the boys were looking at this
    little piece of justifiable brag, two women came along, and paused
    beside them.
  </p>

  <p>
    “‘These—are—my,’” then moving a little further,—“‘jewels.’ Hum! Yes;
    of course. Those are the words that Queen Isabella said to Columbus,
    you know, when she gave him her jewels to fit out his ships.” Both
    then walked away, enriched with the spoils of history.
  </p>

  <p>
    Philip and Harry looked at each other, but made no remarks. Their
    minds were busy in replacing the State of Ohio, Queen Isabella, and
    the noble Cornelia in the niches from which they had been so rudely
    torn. In some ways, that was the most remarkable exhibit they met
    that day at the Fair.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the same table where they had lunch, a young fellow sat down with
    two little boys. They looked poor.
  </p>

  <p>
    “What will you have, Johnny?” the eldest asked one of the little
    fellows.
  </p>

  <p>“Bread ’n’ butter.”</p>

  <p>
    “That’s cheap,” the eldest said; and, after a little more talk, they
    ordered fried sweet-potatoes.
  </p>

  <p>“Nothing else?” the waiter said.</p>

  <p>“Nothing else.”</p>

  <p>When they were through, the waiter was asked “How much?”</p>

  <p>“Ninety cents.”</p>

  <p>
    Then there was silence, while the big boy fumbled in his pockets.
    Four<span class="pagenum">110</span> tiny bits of sweet-potato, bread and butter—ninety cents. It
    was hard, and Harry spoke to the waiter about it.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I can’t help it,” said the waiter. “It’s the rule.” So the bill was
    paid. It was another interesting exhibit.
  </p>

  <p>
    They gladly left this restaurant, and made their way out into the
    honest breeze from the lake, taking their places upon the shore so as
    to see the life-saving drill. It proved well worth coming to see.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first sign of life was two rows of white-jacketed men that filed
    out through the dense crowd which lined the lake shore. The lake was
    rough and spray shot high into the air as the waves rolled against
    the breakwater. But the men rushed the boat down the beach, and
    steered by one who stood in the sternsheets holding a long oar astern
    of the boat they made their way out to a mast that rose from above
    the water’s surface to represent the mast of a wrecked vessel. It was
    a struggle, but they finally reached the mast, and one man and a boy
    got out of the boat and stood upon a small platform not far above the
    waves.
  </p>

  <p>
    With even more difficulty the boat returned to the shore; and, after
    some delay, probably to arrange the life-line and mortar, “bang”
    went the shot, and the line was carried by the missile fairly across
    a boom projecting from the mast. Then the man at the mast hauled
    in this light line until it brought him a heavier one; and again
    he hauled until he had the end of a cable that came from the crew
    on shore. This he rove through a block upon the mast, and made it
    fast. It was made taut by the crew of life-savers, and out along
    this thread of salvation rolled the “breeches buoy,” looking like a
    Quaker’s hat turned upside down.
  </p>

  <div class="figleft">
    <a id="i_123"><img src="images/i_123.jpg" width="200" height="279" alt="" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>
    Into the breeches the boy put his legs, and was hauled ashore by a
    light line.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just as the boy came near shore, his legs came so near the water that
    he drew them up, frog-like, and the great crowd of spectators laughed
    and cheered. Again the little buoy and breeches traveled out to the
    mast. But the man out there had noticed the boy’s gyrations, and
    seated himself on top of the buoy.
  </p>

  <p>
    “You bet your neck he ain’t goin’ to run any chances of getting <em>his</em>
    legs wet!” cried a very appreciative young man; and the wisdom of the
    remark far exceeded its elegance.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the man was landed, the buoy traveled again to the mast and<span class="pagenum">111</span>
    struck against the block there. Automatically, the cable was released
    and hauled ashore, and the same bolt released the rope, dropped a
    sign that had been rolled up like a map, and every one could read in
    plain black letters the words: “<span class="smcap">drill finished</span>.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Before the boys started for the “exit,” it began to rain, and
    immediately there was a fine exhibit of umbrellas from every State
    in the Union. To keep dry the boys walked the whole length of the
    Manufactures Building.
  </p>

  <p>
    Harry timed their walk, and counted his steps. He was going slowly,
    with no desire to break or make a record. It took about 720 steps to
    go the full length of the largest building in the Fair, and the walk
    lasted nine minutes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before they went to bed that night Harry was told of a remark
    overheard by one of his friends. It was made by a tired old lady,
    who had come out of a large building and arrived unexpectedly in a
    strange and distant quarter of the grounds:
  </p>

  <p>
    “Well!” she exclaimed, “when they planned this Fair, they put these
    buildings so that, wherever you come out, you ain’t anywhere nearer
    any thing in particular!”
  </p>

    <span class="smcap">In</span> the old days the navigators at first crept from headland to
    headland; then from island to island, and at last Christopher Colon,
    the intrepid hero of the fifteenth century, conceived the idea of
    sailing boldly forth into the unknown, secure in his faith in himself
    and in his fortunes. At least so Philip said in one of his old school
    compositions. And the boys, having at first touched here and there
    the points of interest, then took up a few of the outlying State
    buildings; but now they intended, as Harry boldly put it, to see the
    elephant from beak to tail-feathers. That is, they planned to enter
    the Building for Manufactures and the Liberal Arts.
  </p>

  <p>
    “This mammoth structure,” began Harry at breakfast, in the tone of a
    dime-museum lecturer, “is steen hundred feet long, and even wider;
    and is provided with wings on all four corners, if not oftener. It
    contains the complete contents of the building, and various souvenirs
    and nickel-in-the-slot machines which are not reckoned in the table
    of contents. Little boys have been seen to enter at one end, and old
    men to come out at the other, besides those who went up on the roof;
    so you can draw your own conclusions.”

    “That’s all very well, Harry,” said Mr. Douglass; “but have you been
    up in that elevator?”
  </p>

  <p>“No, sir.”</p>

  <p>
    “When you go, see if you feel like joking,” Mr. Douglass went on. “I
    went up in it to-day.”
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">114</span></p>

  <p>
    “It’s raining hard,” said Philip, looking out of the window, “and I
    haven’t any rubbers.”
  </p>

  </div>

  <p>“Nor I,” said Harry; “but I didn’t pack the satchels.”</p>

  <p>
    “Well, we forgot them,” said Mr. Douglass; “so I suppose Philip and I
    ought to go out and buy some for the whole party.”
  </p>

  <p>“Let’s all go together,” Harry suggested.</p>

  <p>
    They set forth, keeping a good lookout in all directions for anything
    like a shoe-store. So near the Fair it would have been easier to find
    the rarest thing in the world than simply a pair of rubber shoes.
    But finally they came to a shoe-store, and discovered that they
    were not the only little boys who had failed to imitate the little
    Peterkins in providing themselves with rubber boots. There was a long
    line of customers extending out upon what was called the sidewalk,
    good-naturedly awaiting their turns to be shod. They took their<span class="pagenum">115</span>
    places at the end, and when rather moist, were admitted to the store
    in a chosen batch of six. They had to wait on themselves, and picked
    up the first thing that came. Mr. Douglass’s first catch proved to
    be infants’ overshoes, but Philip found a pair that Mr. Douglass
    could wear. The proprietor told them to help themselves, and make
    themselves at home.

  </div>

  <p>
    “All right,” said one of the customers; “we’ve all gotten acquainted
    while waiting on one another out here.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Once well insulated from the ground, they turned the rattling stile
    at the entrance to the Fair, and picked their way over the mud that
    was like gray paint and nearly as sticky. The program declared that
    it was “Irish Day,” and the same fact shone out from many a noble
    breast,<span class="pagenum">116</span> and many a proud coat-lapel; for green badges flourished
    like bay-trees in the spring, and the shamrock bloomed despite the
    stormy skies.
  </p>

  <p>
    As they crossed a bridge from the Electricity Building to that of
    the Manufactures, they noticed that the dome upon the Illinois State
    Building was as unsubstantial and shadowy as a ghost. The crowd
    talked much less than usual, and there was little laughter. A number
    of French sailors passed them, but even their busy tongues were for
    once silent. The boys were glad to get into the great building,
    for it was here and there lighted by electric lamps, and the gaily
    colored exhibits diverted their minds from the gray and cloudy sky.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Boys,” said Mr. Douglass, as they paused in front of the two
    elephant-tusks that rested before the Siam exhibit, “if you prefer
    it, I will go with you; but, to be frank, I am inclined to think you
    would rather go by yourselves. Whatever you look at, you are sure to
    learn something, even unconsciously. And I am not ashamed to say that
    no one man can explain even to boys of your age a thousandth part of
    what we see here.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Mr. Douglass,” said Philip, “I really think we’d rather go alone, if
    you don’t mind.” “Very well,” the tutor replied; “I shall probably
    stay in this building, too, but it is not likely we shall meet. At
    about half-past<span class="pagenum">117</span> one come over to the bridge that leads to the lower
    end of the wooded island, and I’ll take you to lunch. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au revoir</i>!”
  </p>

  <p>
    “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Auf Wiedersehen!</i>” Harry replied; and turning to Philip he said
    warmly, “Mr. Douglass is a good fellow,—there’s no ‘Uncle George and
    Rollo’ about him.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I think he’s right, too,” said Philip. “If he was to try to tell us
    about things here, we couldn’t listen if we wanted to: there’s too
    much to see.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Well, he’s having a good time, too,” said Harry. “It’s a good idea
    to take your tutor to Chicago and improve his mind. Where shall we
    begin?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “We’ll go over into the publishers’ corner,” said Philip, pointing
    to the little map in his guide-book; “and we’ll take the galleries
    first.”
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">

  <p>
    They walked toward that end of the building, but could not help
    seeing some things on their way. One was a group of curved mirrors
    that gave distorted and very laughable reflections. Another was a
    fine display of daggers, pins, and other jewelry, inlaid in gold.
    Harry took a fancy to one bonnet-pin (he thought it was), the top
    of which was a dainty sword-hilt. He priced it, and left it there:
    it was twelve dollars. The boys saw a placard upon one tiny dagger
    saying it was sold to Miss Blank, and they wondered whether she
    bought it for a paper-knife, or intended to become a vivandière.

  <p>
    On reaching the gallery, they first went through the publishers’
    exhibits, finding original manuscripts and drawings, collections of
    finely bound books, and courteous treatment everywhere.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I think,” said Philip, as they came out of the last of these rooms,
    “that the publishers are all very polite to the public.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Ah,” Harry replied, with a wise shake of the head, “they have to be.
    If they weren’t, why we’d just turn around and say, ‘Here, you, stop
    my subscription!’ and then where would they be? You see, a man can’t
    get along without food, and clothes, and things like that, but he
    needn’t read<span class="pagenum">120</span> if he doesn’t want to—he can just spend his time over
    advertisements, and signs, and things people give away.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Wouldn’t that be nice to have in schools?” said Philip, pointing to
    a big map of the United States upon the wall, nearly twenty-five feet
    high.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_133"><img src="images/i_133.jpg" width="650" height="588" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">PART OF GROUP ABOVE MAIN ENTRANCE OF MANUFACTURES AND

  </div>

  <p>
    “Very,” said Harry; “they’d have to spread it out in the yard, and
    then the teacher would say, ‘Johnny, run out and find Oshkosh, and
    don’t run too fast or you’ll tire yourself before you get there!’”
  </p>

  <p>
    On the opposite wall was “the largest photograph in the world,” a
    very long but uninteresting picture of those words with figures of
    real people leaning on the letters.
  </p>

  <p>
    An old man came by, saw the sign, wondered “<em>where</em> that photograph
    was,” and walked all around the gallery trying to find out. It
    was hardly a successful exhibit, but it was only to attract
    attention—there was a good display of regular work near it.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">121</span></p>

  <p>
    The boys at first stopped everywhere; but soon they began to remember
    what a task was before them, and they quickened their pace.
  </p>

  <p>
    Philip entered but few items in his note-book, and among them was a
    booth entirely covered outside with ordinary playing-cards, which
    gave it an Eastern effect. One object that called for more than a
    glance was an old English clock—the Earl of Pembroke’s clock; it
    was set in a high case of carved wood, most elaborate in design and
    executed with minute skill and care. They saw also a show-case that
    imitated a great trunk some fifteen feet high, with glass sides. But
    they were making slow progress, and hurried on until they reached a
    carved altar made by the inmates of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Joseph’s Orphan Home—a piece
    of woodwork worthy of any hand.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then began a long array of exhibits meant to illustrate the progress
    of scholars in lessons and manual arts. Each compartment was allotted
    to a certain school. For a few rooms the boys kept seriously at
    work examining drawings, carvings, forgings, and compositions; but
    soon they heard a rollicking pianist down-stairs dashing off “<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Patrick’s Day in the Morning,” and it brought memories of home to
    their minds. A lively jig-step was heard, followed by clapping and
    cheering.
  </p>

  <p>
    “See here, Phil,” Harry broke out, facing about, “it may not be
    <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick’s Day, but it certainly is Saturday, and I’m not going
    to be hood-winked into school work to-day. If there are any more
    compositions, kindergartens, and maps drawn by Bertie Wilhelmina
    Marie Jones, you may see them if you like. I am going to skip them.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I’ve seen enough; we’ll never get through this way,” said Philip,
    looking despairingly at his watch. “So we’ll go on to something else.”
  </p>

  <p>“Good-morning, boys,” said a slightly husky voice.</p>

  <p>
    “Good-morning, sir,” they replied, turning to find an old Irishman, a
    respectable quiet-looking man.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I tell you this is a very wonderful show,” he went on, evidently
    feeling that he must talk to some one. And from that beginning he
    went on to tell them that he was over sixty years old, had come to
    America in 1847, and had gone West by the Erie Canal, soon after.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Boys,” said he, impressively, “you’ve no idea of what a country you
    live in. I’ve lived to see wonders in the last thirty years, and
    they’ve changed the whole world, so they have. You can have no idea
    of it, not as I have. And it’s not in the East or in Chicago alone:
    it’s in the whole land. And there’ll be no telling what a country
    it’ll be. I’m over sixty, and I went out forty years ago and took up
    a hundred and sixty acres of bare land, and now there’s people all
    around me: Norwegians, many of them; and it’s good people and good
    neighbors they are!”
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">122</span></p>

  <p>The boys were impressed by the seriousness of the old man’s talk.</p>

  <p>“You are Irish?” asked Philip.</p>

  <p>
    “Of course,” he said, with a smile; and throwing open his overcoat
    he displayed a badge big enough to prove anything. They parted with
    mutual wishes of “good luck.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Since Harry had refused to go further into the exhibits of school
    work, they went down to the main floor, and walked from the southwest
    corner northward. As in the other buildings they had visited, they
    found along the walls little stands where young women had on sale
    penholders, souvenir coins, shell-boxes, necklaces—cheap trinkets of
    all sorts. For the first few days the boys had gone to see what was
    shown at these booths; but soon they found there was pretty much the
    same stock everywhere, and walked by indifferently. They had bought,
    however, a few things—one a little shield showing the arms Queen
    Isabella granted to Columbus.
  </p>

  <div class="figleft">
    <a id="i_135"><img src="images/i_135.jpg" width="200" height="206" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">“—AND THE CAT<br />CAME BACK.”</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Against the wall about half-way up toward the north end were several
    “graphophones”—contrivances something like Edison’s phonograph. On
    dropping a nickel and hooking two hard-rubber tubes into the ears,
    one might hear instrumental music or songs. A small boy tried one
    of those machines while Harry and Philip looked on. The tubes were
    adjusted, and he stood gravely awaiting the result. A smile began
    to dawn on his lips. It spread widely. His mouth opened; he giggled
    aloud; he kept on giggling with his eyes closing through pure joy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Harry tried the machine and found that it was repeating a comic
    singer’s rendering of “The Cat Came Back,” and he grinned quite as
    widely as the small boy had done, and afterward sketched the scene
    with full sympathy.
  </p>

  <p>“That’s a great invention for invalids,” said Philip, thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>
    “Yes,” said Harry, warmly; “think how it would soothe a restless
    invalid during a long night to hear one of those machines grind out
    ‘The Cat Came Back!’”
  </p>

  <div class="figright">

    <div class="caption">A JAPANESE<br />CARVING.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    “Well, it would,” said Philip, as soberly as he could. “You couldn’t
    be sad while listening to that song.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Just as they were leaving, they saw a mother and child listening to
    the same graphophone, each having one ear to an end of the branched
    tube. “I don’t know,” said Philip, “whether that’s quite honest.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The exhibit of a well-known manufacturer of steel pens had in the<span class="pagenum">123</span>
    center of it a pen fully six feet long, apparently quite as huge an
    affair in its own way as the building. The boys stopped at this, but
    perhaps at another time they would have passed that by and looked at
    things they now ignored. There was so much it made them particular.
    If a display was not brightly lighted, or was at all crowded, or
    required a few extra steps, it was left unvisited. Knowing they could
    see only a few things, they simply walked along, and let the exhibits
    show themselves.

  </div>

  <p>
    There passed them in rolling chairs an old minister and his wife, and
    Harry made up his story about them. He imagined one of the deacons
    going to consult with the elders, saying, “The Parson wants to go
    to the World’s Fair. He hasn’t said so exactly; but I can see he
    does. He reads all about it, and he talks about it—tells how big the
    buildings are, and all that. Can’t we send him?” There may have been
    no truth in all this, but it gave<span class="pagenum">124</span> Harry great pleasure to see the
    old couple’s enjoyment. Coming to the upper, or north, end of the
    building, they found the exhibits of stonework, ironwork, paints,
    varnishes, and so on. But they turned back to see the exquisite work
    of artistic Japan. Here were ivories, pottery, metalwork, embroidery,
    odd carving (one little bear, a grotesque figure, Harry stopped to
    sketch)—all designed and executed in perfection. The boys spent
    a long time here, and left dissatisfied. It was time to meet Mr.
    Douglass on the bridge, and they raised umbrellas, tramped through
    the mud, and, finding the tutor waiting for them, were soon on the
    way to the Horticultural Building, where they lunched at a restaurant
    on the second floor.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p>“Where did you go, Mr. Douglass?” Philip asked.</p>

  <p>
    “I went to the other end of the grounds, to the Anthropological
    Building. I heard there was a set of apparatus for measuring
    nerve-force, mental-power,<span class="pagenum">125</span> and so on, which would be applied to a
    visitor. I went through the process, and found it very interesting,
    though it took a long time.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Did you notice the Hunters’ Camp and the Australian Bark Hut near
    the bridge we came over?” Harry asked.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_138"><img src="images/i_138.jpg" width="500" height="327" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">THE FIRE-BOAT “FIRE QUEEN.”</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    “Yes; and went into both,” said Mr. Douglass. “How well they contrast
    with these enormous, complex show-buildings, reminding us how much
    that is shown here is not necessary to life or happiness! After lunch
    I’ll go back with you to the main building, and we’ll ride up to the
    roof.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Walking back, they noticed on the railings of the bridge a
    life-preserver and line, hung ready to be thrown at once to any
    one who might fall in. They also saw the “Fire Queen,” a steamboat
    fire-engine, lying ready for service by the same bridge. “That
    shows,” Mr. Douglass said, “how carefully everything here has been
    thought out.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Returning to the big building, they went through the silversmiths’
    and jewelers’ exhibits, which were rich and elegant without being
    gaudy or tiresome. There were great crowds here—and they saw only
    a few of the pieces of silverware and jewelry. The Tiffany Glass
    Company’s beautiful chapel they pronounced one of the successes of
    the Fair, and just opposite they stopped to examine many watches,
    watch-movements, and the machines that made them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Coming to the elevators, they bought tickets and entered, without
    particular thought about the trip. The door was closed, and the
    elevator began its upward journey. Until it was near the top Harry
    didn’t look down. All at once he turned his head and saw the awful
    depth, where<span class="pagenum">126</span> tiny figures moved noiselessly about. He was not an
    over-sensitive boy, but for the minute the sensation was one of
    appalled horror. It was not fear—he had no dread that the elevator
    would fall; he only felt the terrible height. It was an instinctive
    human shrinking before the immensity of space.
  </p>

  <p>
    He turned away, and did not recover for several minutes. He had no
    inclination to joke, and, indeed, for a while he could hardly summon
    courage to step upon the board walk that led out upon the roof.
    Perhaps Mr. Douglass and Philip had somewhat similar feelings, for
    all three sat down upon a bench outside, and did not attempt to walk
    around the roof.
  </p>

  <p>
    That one moment of dread did more to make the boys understand what a
    monster building they were in, than columns of figures, comparisons,
    and statistics could have accomplished. About smaller buildings one
    can reason; but this can be comprehended only when one is awed by its
    immensity.

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">The</span> next morning Philip decided that whatever the others were going
    to do, he had left the Art Galleries alone long enough, and that he
    would spend a part of his day wandering among pictures and statues.
  </p>

  <p>
    He walked from the southern end, where he had entered, along the
    whole length of the grounds. When he came to the bridge crossing the
    waterway between the North Pond and the Lagoon, he met two ladies
    evidently at a loss whether to turn to the right or the left in
    order to reach the Art Galleries. Raising his hat, he drew forth
    the map and showed them that they could go as well one way as the
    other; and then he walked on, himself turning to the right. As he
    went along a path that led him around some of the smaller National
    Buildings, he saw a little grove of trees surrounding a boulder
    built of staff. Along the top of this great rock was a figure, also
    of staff, representing a lioness with the head and shoulders of a
    woman—a sort of sphinx; a Cupid was whispering to her, and she had an
    expression half of amusement and half of malice. There was no legend
    or inscription attached to the piece of sculpture, and all were left
    to make their own interpretation of the allegory.
  </p>

  <p>
    Considering the wealth of art stored up in the winged temple to which
    he was going, Philip did not dare to waste any time in reaching his
    goal; but first he drew out his little guide-book, and examining the
    plan that showed where the pictures of each nation were grouped, he
    decided to begin with the French section—that is, with the east wing.
  </p>

  <p>
    He mounted the great steps, flanked by lions, and found himself at
    once surrounded by pictures on all four walls of a square room whose
    curtained doorways led to similar treasures beyond. Like all the
    world when in a picture-gallery, he did not see how he could examine
    the collection systematically. He was too much interested. Perhaps he
    would make up his mind to begin at the right-hand corner, and would
    march resolutely in that direction. Upon the way he would catch sight
    of a thrilling battle-scene or a lovely face, and would pause, become
    fascinated, and lose all recollection of his plan of campaign.

  <p>
    After standing bewildered for a minute or two, Philip turned to look
    especially at a large painting showing Christ talking to the woman at
    the well, a beautiful and dignified piece of work, emphasizing the
    serenity and solemnity of the scene. Philip felt that this picture
    had put him in a receptive frame of mind, such as one should have
    when listening to a sermon; and not long afterward came a series of
    four well-known pictures, “The Prodigal Son,” by Tissot, to preach
    the sermon. They represented a modern reading of the parable, showing
    the father bidding his son farewell; the son in anything but good
    company while absent; the return—a touching picture, showing the old
    father leaning to raise the young man kneeling at his feet; and the
    merrymaking over the fatted calf.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although Philip had come primarily for Art alone, it was impossible
    for him to ignore the stories the artists had chosen as foundations
    for their compositions. In “<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George and the Dragon,” for instance,
    who could help<span class="pagenum">130</span> making up little bits of the story that had brought
    the bold <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George to the mouth of the rocky den where lay that very
    stupid and malicious monster with one cruel paw holding a victim at
    its feet?
  </p>

  <p>
    Even that brilliant piece of coloring, “The Birth of the Pearl,”
    required the story-telling faculty to account for the swift bubbling
    plunge of the diver who opens the iridescent shell beneath which the
    Pearl Maiden is sleeping. A story nearly as good as the “Sleeping
    Beauty” was told in those gem-like colors.

  </div>

  <p>
    Of more direct interest to the boy was “A Singing Lesson in a Public
    School in Paris”; and Philip gladly would have spent much time in
    reading the little touches of character that made each boy in the
    crowded picture so interesting a figure. But he knew that he must
    slight many pictures in order to give any time at all to those which
    held him before them by making him forget everything else; so he went
    on to the next gallery. He was first delighted by “The Bath of the
    Regiment,” a barrack-scene showing the members of a regiment passing
    one by one in front of a hose in full play: the spattering water,
    the wet floor, the shining skins of the soldiers were wonderfully
    rendered considering the difficulty of painting the details from
    nature.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">131</span></p>

  <p>
    Another striking picture was the portrait of Pope Leo XIII. Philip
    recalled having read that the Pope had never before granted any
    artist a sitting; but that M. Chartran, being granted an audience,
    made a sketch that so pleased the Pope as to gain for the artist
    permission to paint this wonderful picture. The expression of the
    face was purely intellectual and refined, and Philip felt sure the
    picture would never be regarded as other than a masterpiece. There
    were two small portraits by Weerts that were worthy to be ranked with
    this larger one. Two others, landscapes, also claimed attention, one
    a dainty bit of bright color by Gagliardini—a Moorish scene; and the
    other, by Lhermitte, “Harvesters at Rest,” showing peasants in the
    field. The only other picture that Philip marked upon his catalogue
    was a group of children in an arm-chair, by G. Dubufe, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fils</i>.

    <div class="caption">IN FRONT OF THE FINE ARTS BUILDING.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Speaking of Philip’s catalogue, it is well to say that he bought
    two. The first was so arranged that after walking through one room
    with it he returned, and paid three times as much for the second.
    The more expensive catalogue numbered the pictures as they were hung
    upon the walls, and he could find each picture at once—a matter worth
    considering when he knew he could not see a third of the rooms in
    each of which were many masterpieces.

  <p>
    Entering another gallery, Philip drew a line of approval against “A
    First Proof,” by Mathey—a printer examining the first impression from
    a plate; a similar line was awarded to “The Struggle for Life”—a
    marine showing a long line of men trying to draw a fishing-boat
    through the surf to safety. Others he marked were a soft evening
    effect by Zuber, and, in the next gallery, “The Virgin’s Thread,”
    that lovely painting by Lucas, where the birds are pulling at the
    thread while the virgin is sleeping in her chair beside the wheel.
    A picture of a boar at bay, while the hounds snarl, and whine but
    hesitate to come to close quarters, and a “Strike” picture, also
    compelled him to halt and to enter.

  <p>
    But he felt as Ali Baba must have felt in the
    treasure-cavern—dazzled, longing to take all he could, but hurried
    and ill at ease. It is easy for an arm-chair philosopher to advise
    patience and coolness; to say, “Select a little, and see it
    thoroughly”; but to be a visitor at the greatest of World’s Fairs is
    quite another matter, and in the Art Galleries you can never tell
    what you are losing.
  </p>

  <p>
    They issued in Chicago several useful little handbooks to the Fair.
    “The Time-Saver,” “The Nutshell Guide,” “Gems of the Fair,” “What to
    See and How to Find It,” were some of them, and by reading these one
    could be fairly sure of not overlooking many “best” things in the
    trade exhibits. But in the Art Galleries such books can be of little
    use. The pictures Philip looked at pleased him for various reasons.
    Some were by consummate colorists; some told a pleasing tale; some
    preached a little sermon; some were amusing, and others played upon
    deeper chords. Now, as to these no two boys or men would feel just
    alike; and you can no more let another pick out your pictures than
    you can let a stranger order your meals.
  </p>

  <p>As Philip was standing in one of the galleries an old man said slyly:</p>

  <p>“No awards here.”</p>

  <p>“Is that so?” asked Philip in surprise.</p>

  <p>
    “Yes,” said the old man; “the French found the Germans were beating
    them, and so they quit!” And the old man disappeared in the crowd,
    chuckling to himself, and seeming to take more interest in this bit
    of gossip than in the pictures.
  </p>

  <p>
    Philip went on through two rooms containing pastels and water-colors;
    he meant to skip them entirely. It was not that he undervalued these
    mediums, but he felt he had to draw the line somewhere (as in the old
    story of the man who didn’t invite his parents to his wedding); and
    the oil-paintings were more numerous.
  </p>

  <p>
    But he was compelled to look at three pictures by Boutet-de-Monvel
    because they were just what he liked, at one by Maurice Eliot, and
    at some hunting-dogs resting by a river, painted by Oliver de Penne.
    He made up for this pause by skipping two large collections of
    miniatures, etchings, and medals, and began to go around the room
    known as “Gallery 45.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Here he found two pictures that have caused much controversy—one
    showing the Crucifixion as upon Montmartre, Paris, and the other
    representing Christ as sitting at table in a modern drawing-room.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum">137</span></p>
  <p>
    Philip didn’t pretend to say whether there was a great moral lesson
    conveyed by this strange device; but he felt that the pictures
    were as unpleasant as they were powerful; and that of the Crucifixion
    was certainly full of intense feeling rendered by the hand of a
    master.
  </p>

  <p>
    But it is useless to quote from the catalogue as Philip marked it;
    for himself the markings were useful, and helped him to fix his
    attention upon certain pictures; but unless all of the pictures are
    at hand, comparison and comment can have little value.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the boy went through the galleries, he felt a strong sense of
    gratitude to the hundreds of skilful, keen-sighted men who had
    studied nature and mankind until they could show him in an instant’s
    glance just how things were and are the whole world around.

  <p>
    From the French exhibit he passed to that of American artists; and
    again he found reason to be proud of his young country. Perhaps it
    was as well that the French and American exhibits were distinctly
    labeled, for there was not such a difference as there might have
    been. But if America showed that she had taken lessons abroad, she at
    least gave her teachers no reason to be ashamed; and here and there
    was seen a touch of true individuality promising a distinction and a
    difference in the future.
  </p>

  <p>
    Julian Story’s painting of “<abbr title="Mademoiselle">Mlle.</abbr> de Sombreuil” and Carl Marr’s great
    “Flagellants” were two history-lessons which no boy could forget;
    and the second of these artists, in another painting where bits of
    real sunshine come flickering through a screen of green leaves,
    showed that he could paint pictures, even without telling historical
    incidents. Philip went close to this picture to see just how that
    shining sunshine was done; but he was surprised to find nothing to
    explain the brightness of those shining spots except a little dull
    ocher paint gradually lightening to white.
  </p>

  <p>
    After he had seen, in the next room, Douglas Volk’s “Puritan Girl”
    and Hovenden’s “Breaking Home Ties,” he became a little depressed;
    but was cheered up by Toby Rosenthal’s comedy, “A Dancing-Lesson of
    our Grandmother’s.”
  </p>

  <p>
    When he went outside to sit upon the steps for a moment’s rest, he
    began to understand Sir Isaac Newton’s simile about picking up a
    few shells on the shore; for he saw that he had been several hours
    in the Art Building, and had seen hastily only a part of one wing
    of the great storehouse. He hurried back, rushed blindly through
    several rooms, and tried to take a small piece out of Great Britain’s
    display. Again he was caught here and drawn there by the magic brush
    of one artist after another, and had to confess that he must raise
    the siege and hope for another day. He walked down the steps with a
    sense of injury and loss, which remained with him until the outdoor
    air and the breeze from the lake had restored his good humor.

  <p>
    He concluded to walk home, and made his way to the path that ran
    along the lake-shore. Philip found his muscles a little sore, and
    seeing a vacant bench, sat down upon it. In a few moments he saw
    a group of young men pointing out upon the lake. He looked in the
    direction they indicated, and to his amazement made out the “Santa
    Maria” under full sail and as independent as any steamer of them all.
    Philip felt as if he might be an Indian viewing the first coming of
    the caravel, and wished sincerely that he were aboard, so that he
    might shut his eyes and imagine he heard that first cry, “Land! Land!”
  </p>

  <p>
    He was delighted with the chance that had brought him the sight of
    the caravel at sea, and wondered what nabob of the Fair was cruising
    about as if he were Christopher Columbus himself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Resuming his walk, he went through one or two of the buildings
    in order to get out of the sun (which beat down quite fiercely,
    considering how late in the year it was). In the Liberal Arts
    Building it seemed that only frail pieces of plate-glass protected
    the rich treasures of gold and silver arranged in the jewelers’
    show-windows, and Harry wondered whether a modern Dick Turpin, or
    Blackbeard the Pirate, could not, by dash and nerve, succeed in
    carrying away enough plunder to support him forever after in some
    reputable line of business. The pirate, he thought, would have the
    better chance; for he might rush to the shore, where his trusty crew
    were awaiting him in the long-boat, be rowed to his stealthy black
    vessel, hoist sail, and away with all that Tiffany and the Gorham
    Company had left out of their safes!
  </p>

  <p>
    Then what a scurrying to and fro! Sailors and soldiers, losing
    their presence of mind, would dash up to the conning-tower of
    the battle-ship “Illinois” and press the dummy electric buttons,
    wondering why the engineer didn’t get up all steam and put on full
    speed at once. Others would leap into the “Viking” and start to row
    with the long sweeps, forgetting that there were only shields aboard.
  </p>

  <p>
    Philip was amused at this odd fancy, and resolved to ask Harry to
    make a sketch of the pursuit. Meanwhile he made his way home, keeping
    in the porticos where it was shady, and avoiding the clayey mud left
    by the previous day’s rain.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I’d rather,” he told Harry that night, “miss some of the regular
    exhibits, if I’ve got to take the Fair in samples; when it comes to
    missing pictures, you never know what you’ve lost.”
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">140</span></p>

  <p>
    The next morning Mr. Douglass, who was reading the “Chicago Tribune,”
    burst out laughing. “Philip,” said he, “here is part of an account of
    the cruise of the ‘Santa Maria’—the cruise upon which you saw her.”
    And, interrupted by the boys’ occasional chuckles, he read aloud as
    follows:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The old caravel stood out on the waves, queer-looking as compared
      with modern craft, but full of grace and beauty. When the big square
      sail was first spread, it took the wind nicely, rounded the pier, and
      sailed off to the northwest in splendid style.
    </p>

    <p>
      But when the passengers wanted to turn the caravel there was trouble.
      Had they continued in a straight line to Michigan all would have been
      well, but they knew not how to sail the “Santa Maria.” The craft
      wobbled. The choppy waves tossed it. Though it had braved storms on
      the Atlantic, it trembled, and its sails became disorganized by the
      turbulence of the white-topped waves of Lake Michigan.
    </p>

    <p>
      “It will not sail close to the wind,” said a passenger who claimed to
      have been out on the lake before.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Better slow her up,” suggested passenger Millet; “we’re headed for
      the Forty-third street reef.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Who ever heard of a reef on a street?” petulantly returned
      Sailing-master Hunt.
    </p>

    <p>
      On flew the caravel until the cheeks of the passengers turned pale,
      and they pleaded with the captain to turn it about. Its huge hulk was
      finally swerved just as it scraped the reef. Away it shot again out
      northwest, more unruly than before.
    </p>

    <p>
      An hour or so went by. The “Santa Maria” still sped on toward the
      Michigan fruit-fields. The passengers became hungry. They wanted to
      go home. A turn about of the caravel was finally made. It shot away
      toward the Van Buren street pier.
    </p>

    <p>“Land her!” “Land her!” “Ground her!” cried the passengers.</p>

    <p>
      With care the caravel was brought up near enough to the pier to let
      off the passengers, and the craft was anchored for the night.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then Mr. Armour said to Millet: “No wonder Columbus discovered America.”
    </p>

    <p>“Why?” inquired the latter.</p>

    <p>
      “Because a man could discover anything in such a craft as the ‘Santa
      Maria.’ There’s no telling what direction it would carry him. The
      discovery of America was a ‘scratch.’”
    </p>

      <a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" title="Return to text"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> With regard to the little bust of his grandmother,
      carved in birch-wood, Mr. Zorn says: “I have painted my grandmother
      a great many times, and the pictures have always been sold, so I
      made this little carving as something to keep. From beginning to end
      it was carved from nature and with carvers’ tools. My grandmother,”
      he adds, “is very picturesque”; but this we do not need to be told,
      nor that there were probably other reasons why her grandson wished
      to have a portrait of her; nor again, that this bust probably is
      a portrait in the fullest, exactest sense of the word. It is a
      delightful thing in subject as in execution. Every detail of the
      sweet, strong old peasant face is lovingly rendered, and yet one
      thinks most not of details or even of features, but of the soul
      behind them.—<cite>“The Century” for August, 1893.</cite>

    <span class="smcap">On</span> Saturday, Philip had heard that for five dollars he could secure
    permission to use his kodak for a week, and by going to the office
    of the official photographer on that day and paying the necessary
    amount, he was able to dismiss from his mind any anxiety about
    carrying his camera. So on Monday the two boys and Mr. Douglass
    entered the grounds, fully equipped with note-book, sketch-book, and
    camera.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hitherto Philip had been asked but once to exhibit the license, but
    this time he was challenged by one of the ticket-takers, who shouted
    to another, “Hi, Jack, here’s a kodak!” But, as it turned out,
    neither ticket-taker cared to examine the card, and Philip merely
    waved it, saying, “It’s all right.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The day was too rainy to risk taking snap-shots, and Philip carried
    the camera during the forenoon only, and was glad to leave it behind
    at the hotel when he returned to lunch.
  </p>

  <p>
    They had down on the list for this day a trip to Chicago; but had
    asked to have the date of their tickets for the coach changed when
    they saw the sky was gloomy and overcast. Instead of going into
    the city, therefore, they resolved to give their morning to the
    Agricultural and the Machinery Buildings. They walked first to the
    Manufactures Building to get letters, and took a launch back again.
    While waiting for the boat they had some conversation with the man at
    the landing, and were surprised to learn that each of the launches
    cost more than three thousand dollars—the high price being paid
    mainly for the machinery.

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum">143</span></p>

  <p>
    Landing at the Agricultural Building, they were glad to escape the
    rain—a thunderstorm—by entering at the main door. The exhibits seemed
    to be arranged according to nationalities, the first one they came
    upon being that of Porto Rico; and the boys were really surprised,
    upon exploring their minds, to find out how little they knew about
    Porto Rico. Mr. Douglass knew a little more: he told them it was
    an island—one of the Greater Antilles—and belonged to Spain; but
    there he came to a sudden stop, and directed the boys’ attention to
    a miniature fort in which bottles of wine served as guns. Having to
    that extent improved their knowledge of Porto Rico, they moved on
    a few steps, and seemed to have walked into a cigar-box. The odor
    was explained when they saw before them Cuba’s display, which was
    not unlike that of a prosperous tobacconist. British Guiana did not
    repel them, though a woman cried out, “Oh, alligators and snakes!”
    as she turned hastily away. She was followed by two more of the less
    timid sort, one of whom said resolutely, “Come in. I want to see
    this alligator. I never saw one in my life”; to which her companion
    replied, “Well, gaze on him; there he is!”
  </p>

  <p>
    “You might think, boys,” said Mr. Douglass, as the boys smiled at
    this dialogue, “that such people got no good from coming to the Fair.
    But I think such a conclusion would be a mistake. The foolish chatter
    we hear has little to do with what people are really thinking. They
    cannot help picking up clearer ideas of the world and its inhabitants
    as they go through these buildings. Where one sees fruits and grains,
    it means that this or the other country has orchards and farms. We
    thus get rid of many a foolish mental picture. We cease to imagine
    that all the Chinese are continually flying kites and smoking
    opium, or that all Spaniards are eternally strumming guitars in the
    sunshine. You may not think you have such foolish ideas, but you will
    probably find yourself entertaining notions quite as absurd. I only
    say this because we hear so much trivial chatter that you might be
    misled by it.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Well, Mr. Douglass,” Harry answered, “I have seen plenty of men, and
    women too, who are taking the Fair almost too seriously. And even
    the most foolish must find a great deal that makes him think. I know
    I do. Now, for instance, look at that figure”; and Harry pointed to
    the model of a negro workman that made part of the exhibit labeled
    “British Guiana.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I saw him,” said Mr. Douglass, “and I noticed how his leather
    sandals have absurd twirls and coils of leather thongs about them.
    The rest of his dress is very ordinary.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Those are just what I mean,” said Harry. “I said to myself, at first
    glance, that those twisted rolls of leather were silly ornaments,
    and showed<span class="pagenum">144</span> that the man was a savage in civilized clothes. Then I
    wondered whether they hadn’t some use, and—”

  <p>“I see,” said Mr. Douglass, interrupting.</p>

  <p>“Well, I don’t,” Philip declared.</p>

  <p>
    “Suppose he should break a sandal-string,” said Harry, eagerly;
    “don’t you understand that he could just untwist one of those coils,
    just as a violin-player unwinds a little more of his E string?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Yes, of course,” Philip said; “and that is the most convenient way
    for him to carry the strings.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I have little doubt that the coils came from that necessity
    for mending,” Mr. Douglass remarked; “but probably the dandies
    exaggerated the coils. This idea of yours, Harry, reminds me of an
    article by Remington, the artist. It was written to show that good
    sense dictated the whole costume of the Western cowboy. I kept it,
    and will show it to you.”

    Liberia displayed various native products, and fine works in metal
    and straw and leather, but the party did not see anything to warrant
    a long stay; Mexico had so arranged her exhibits that they reminded
    one of a grocery kept by a neat but eccentric grocer; but wherever
    the flag of Japan was displayed, the boys never grudged time for
    examination. That artistic little nation can always teach a lesson to
    natives of the young Occident. Even in their display of food-stuffs,
    the boys found the pickle-jars, saké-kegs, and some boxes<span class="pagenum">145</span> worth
    looking at. In fact, Harry was so pleased with these artistic
    groceries that his sketch-book came out at once. The pickle-jar was
    covered with white paper draped in graceful lines and tied down with
    a twisted purple cord and tassels! The saké-keg and the box also
    showed the same wish to please the eye and satisfy the needs of each
    article; and as for some larger jars, they were dressed as richly as
    a ball-room belle. They left the domains of the white flag and red
    disk with some instruction in the art of “framing” groceries.

    Whenever the party first entered one of the exhibition buildings,
    they examined the earlier booths somewhat carefully; but a sense of
    losing time soon made them hurry on. So it was then. They walked on
    by many a fine arrangement of food-products—notably those of the
    Western grain-producing States. They admired the taste and skill
    that had utilized glass tubes full of grains as columns, and corn on
    the cob as a building material. Mr. Douglass said that much foolish
    criticism had been evoked by these booths, but that a sight of the
    structures themselves called for approval rather than fault-finding.
    They particularly admired the displays of Wisconsin, Nebraska, Iowa,
    and Ohio, in which both the general effect and the bits of color
    decoration showed good taste and much constructive skill.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I shouldn’t be surprised,” said Harry, “to come upon a Greek temple
    built exclusively of old shoes.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Here they were stopped by a bit of fun. A bright-faced young woman
    was throwing little tin forks out among the crowd; these tin forks
    advertised a brand of sardines, and were made in the shape of a
    little fish, the tail reaching to the tines of the fork. Picking<span class="pagenum">146</span>
    up the forks, the boys naturally went to see the exhibit, and were
    invited to take a sardine, free, from an open box. They declined, but
    others were not so lucky. One old man eagerly plunged his fork into
    the box only to discover that the fish were painted tin. He fled into
    the crowd while the bystanders laughed at him. This device certainly
    attracted plenty of attention, but whether it was wise was doubtful.

  <p>
    They finished the aisle they were in, and crossed to another, which
    they walked down, having gone up the first.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the Greek exhibit they saw some tobacco labeled as from
    Thermopylæ, which at the moment seemed incongruous; but reflection
    showed that Thermopylæ must be something beside a battle-field.
    Louisiana had built herself an Egyptian temple of sugar-cane,
    and again Harry made a sketch, for he found the effect very
    pleasing. Passing a number of other booths, they at last came to
    the agricultural implements, and found that there was more to know
    than shovel, spade, and hoe, or even plow and harrow. They frankly
    confessed ignorance of the mechanism and purpose of most of the
    nickel-plated apparatus, and concluded that in their present state of
    ignorance time spent here would be wasted. They did smile, however,
    at seeing a harvesting-machine labeled: “The judges ordered this<span class="pagenum">147</span>
    harvester to be tried in a field of standing grain. It is a little
    disfigured, but still in the ring.”
  </p>

  <p>
    A sign revealing the location of the “Sandwich Manufacturing Co.”
    somehow reminded them that they must see something of Machinery Hall
    before lunch, and they started toward that building, passing on their
    way a “prairie-breaking plow”—a rude but enormous implement that had
    been used with a team of six or eight oxen in first turning up the
    new Western soil.
  </p>

  <p>
    As they were coming out, they paused, even in the rain, to admire the
    fine proportions of the Agricultural Building; its dignified portico,
    the fine groups and single statues that adorned its principal
    features,—such as Martiny’s “Abundance,” for example, and the signs
    of the zodiac, and the great corridors that unite Agricultural and
    Machinery Halls.

  </div>

  <p>
    Upon entering Machinery Hall, and finding that they could not give
    anything like adequate time to it, they went at once to the gallery
    and waited for the traveling-crane. There are three of these, each
    originally used for putting in place the heavy exhibits; they run
    upon great girders supported from the floor upon uprights similar
    to those upholding an elevated railroad. Moved by electricity, they
    traverse the whole length of the building and then return, carrying
    passengers twenty or thirty feet above the crowded floors and at an
    excellent height to permit of overlooking the show.
  </p>

  <p>
    They had to wait a little while, but soon the great floating beam of
    iron came against the edge of the gallery, almost as lightly as a bit
    of thistle-down, and they entered at one end and sat down upon chairs
    ranged along the front edge. The crane carried them to the other end
    and back again for ten cents, and without effort they had at least a
    glance at all the exhibits in that part of the Hall—thus obtaining,
    no doubt, a better idea of what there was in the building than could
    have been secured in a long walk below.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to show how bewildering were the displays, here is a
    list that Philip made while Waiting for the crane to move. It
    shows only what he<span class="pagenum">148</span> could easily make out from the extreme end
    of the hall. There were machines relating to hot baths, candy,
    lubrication, ice-cream, smokeless furnaces, rock-drills, galvanizing,
    window-washing, and baking.

  </div>

  <p>
    They found the ride cooling and breezy, and saw enough to
    greatly interest them on all parts of the floor. The enormous
    printing-presses were especially “impressive,” as Harry put it,
    and one press was printing colored illustrations of the World’s
    Fair buildings. Besides, they noticed many looms, sewing-machines,
    a spool-cotton exhibit, dyeing works, glove-making- and
    washing-machines—each something novel or interesting. They attempted
    to see all they could, and keep eyes and brains active; but Harry
    said it reminded him of the small darkey who “slipped back two steps
    for every one he took forward”; for they missed two exhibits by
    pausing to examine any one. They had meant to take a ride upon the
    other crane; but when they saw there were three, they agreed, as
    usual, to be content with a half-seen show, and departed from the
    grounds, going back to their hotel for lunch.
  </p>

  <p>
    The dining-room, so crowded at breakfast- and dinner-time, was almost
    deserted at noon; and they found they could talk over their plans
    with perfect freedom.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mr. Douglass and Philip made several proposals: the Art Galleries;
    another visit to Machinery Hall; more State buildings; the
    Anthropological Building—an inexhaustible resource. But Harry shook
    his head at each suggestion, until at last Philip said:
  </p>

  <p>
    “It’s plain that you have a plan of your own, and I’ve a good mind to
    veto it anyway. What is it?”

    “I have wasted my time very patiently with you this morning,” Harry
    said gravely, “because I suppose we ought to ‘do’ the Fair. But I
    remember that the English poet said, ‘The correct thing for man to
    study is man.’ See? Now, we have been looking at staff and iron and
    steel and corn and wheat and bottles and strings and other precious
    metals all these hours. I have gone through it, though the buzzing
    and rattling and thumping and worrying were decidedly unpleasant.
    Now I want to study man. There is near this hotel, I have learned
    by careful study of bill-posters’ literature, a gentleman who was a
    member of the legislature, etc., etc.,—but who is known among us boys
    by the name of Bison William.”
  </p>

  <p>“I have heard of him,” said Mr. Douglass, with a grave face.</p>

  <p>“Who has not?” said Harry, enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>
    “He is now conducting an educational exhibit near here, where one may
    see various nations at their sports and pastimes. And, gentlemen of
    the jury, what I say is: Let the machinery whirl, and let us devote
    ourselves to the Wild West Show. What do you say?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I’d like to go,” said Philip; “but I wish it was a better day for
    taking pictures.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I’m willing,” said Mr. Douglass. “I saw the show some years ago in
    New York, and it was well worth seeing. I am not sure that a whole
    day of systematic sight-seeing at the Fair is not a little too much
    when one is busy at it for a week or two at a time. Where is it?”

    “Just around the corner,” Harry answered. “And Phinney says it is
    twice as good as it used to be.”
  </p>

  <p>
    A short walk from the hotel brought them to the grounds, a great
    square open space around which were seats like those upon base-ball
    grounds. They bought tickets for the grand stand, and gazed expectant
    upon a sea of mud. The sign said “Rain or Shine,” and rain it was:
    no drizzle, but a pelting downpour that roared upon the roofs
    overhead. Boys walked to and fro, one crying, “Sour crystallized
    lemonade-drops—souvenir in every package,” and the other,
    “Peanuts!—are five cents!”

  <p>
    The rain plashed in the puddles upon the arena, and the boys were
    not sorry; it was a new sensation to see a performance in the
    rain. A band played loud enough to be heard nearly to the Rocky
    Mountains, a man in a very broad-brimmed felt hat mounted a rostrum
    imitating a boulder, put on a rubber coat, and, when the band
    was hushed, began a speech at the top of his lungs,—so loud that
    he hadn’t breath for more than a word or two at a time. He said,
    “Ladies—and—gentlemen:—From time—to—time, I shall—announce—the
    nature—of the—display,” and so on. One seldom hears so forcible an
    oration.
  </p>

  <p>
    He announced one by one the bands of Indians, their chiefs, the
    white men, their captains or leaders, and each of the items upon the
    program. But his shouts can be omitted with the assurance that he did
    his level best. One example will be enough.
  </p>

  <p>“The Arapahoes!”</p>

  <p>
    A gate is unbarred, yells break through, and helter-skelter come a
    troop of almost naked savages painted and bedecked, riding their
    ponies at a run. They draw up before the grand stand.
  </p>

  <p>“Their chief!”</p>

  <p>
    A single Indian comes flying across the field lashing his running
    pony, and draws up before his band.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then, in order, come other tribes until a motley, bright-colored
    rank of mounted warriors are ranged all along the front of the
    field. Then French cavalry ride in with similar heralding, except
    that the color-bearer is announced separately and the band plays the
    Marseillaise. German lancers follow to the tune of “Die Wacht am
    Rhine,” and after them, Mexicans, American cowboys, British Lancers,
    and Cossacks perched on high saddles. The Indians are holding their
    shields above their heads to protect themselves<span class="pagenum">152</span> from the rain.
    Now Arabs come, and two women riders; an old guide, gray-bearded
    and dressed in fringed buckskins; United States cavalrymen, riding
    upon gray horses; and at last, cheered even more than the Stars and
    Stripes, there gallops to the head of that great array an honorable
    gentleman, of whom Harry remarks: “That is Biffalo Bull himself—and a
    fine-looking man he is!”
  </p>

  <p>
    At a signal from the scout the whole cavalcade springs into life
    and rapid motion. The plain is dotted with horsemen dressed in gay
    uniforms; and just then the sun breaks out to brighten the scene,
    and a rainbow is seen above the right-hand portion of the grounds as
    the riders follow one another out. It was certainly a brilliant and
    cheerful pageant.
  </p>

  <p>
    A well-known markswoman runs over the liquid mud, making swimming
    motions with her arms, and taking up a gun breaks clay pigeons and
    glass balls as fast as they can be supplied by the attendants. Fancy
    shooting follows, and, making a miss, the woman walks around the
    table where the guns are resting. This whimsical performance makes
    the people laugh.
  </p>

  <div class="figleft">
    <a id="i_165"><img src="images/i_165.jpg" width="100" height="222" alt="" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>
    Several usual features follow. A race between riders of different
    nations; the “pony express,” an exhibition of rapid shifting from one
    horse to another; an emigrant-train attacked by Indians, but saved
    by the blank cartridges of the Hon. Mr. Cody and his rough-riding
    friends; and then come Syrians and Arabians in wonderful feats of
    balancing, juggling, and pyramid-grouping. In this last act one of
    the men supported nine others in the air—a weight of perhaps twelve
    hundred pounds.
  </p>

  <p>
    “And yet,” Harry remarked, “some men find it hard to support a small
    family.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Always interesting, the thick mud made the show funny as well. It was
    hard for men and horses to secure a foothold: Syrian acrobats stopped
    to wash their muddy hands in almost equally muddy water; some of the
    fierce horses were compelled to drop almost into a walk instead of
    running madly across the arena; when a marksman wished to lie down
    in order to shoot from that position, it required careful search to
    find firm ground for his blanket; the men who built themselves into
    pyramids bedaubed one another until their dresses were mud-color
    instead of crimson; and all through the long, delightful program the
    sticky mud took a prominent part in amusing the spectators.
  </p>

  <p>
    When “Old John Nelson” rode up near where the boys sat, and delivered
    the mail from the old original Deadwood coach, he hurled it off with
    the regulation speech, “Here’s the Deadwood mail,” and then added,<span class="pagenum">153</span>
    winking to Harry, “A little damp, too; but never mind!” The same
    genial old guide, who was lying lazily across the coach roof, raised
    himself coolly as the scouts cried, “Indians! Indians!” and again
    grinning at the boys, remarked in a low tone, “Going to be Indians,
    eh? Then I’ll get up!”
  </p>

  <div class="figright">

    <div class="caption">A COW-BOY.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    This by-play delighted the boys; but best of all was “Custer’s Last
    Charge.”
  </p>

  <p>
    First came the Indians, and encamped far away across the plain. A
    scout followed; discovered them with plenty of gestures to let the
    audience into the secret; reconnoitered them over the imitation
    rock; rode off to tell “Custer” and his staff—mainly buglers—of the
    great find; brought back the general, who gazed meaningly at the red
    villains through a warlike night-glass, and then all the white men
    retired for reinforcements.
  </p>

  <p>
    Coming back, the cavalrymen charged fiercely on the Indians, fired
    off several dollars’ worth of gunpowder, and disappeared behind a
    curtain. Mournful music indicated the terrible fate of the cavalrymen.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the whole afternoon the boys sat beside a boy from Chicago who
    told them many particulars about the show and the riders. He said he
    had seen the performance four or five times, but seemed nevertheless
    to enjoy it. Harry learned that the young Chicagoan sometimes came to
    New York city, and gave the boy his address, inviting him to call.
  </p>

  <p>
    It began to rain again as they went home, but it was only a short
    distance to the hotel, and they went straight to that goal in
    spite of a most pressing invitation to “Take supper here now for
    twenty-five cents, and go home by the light of the moon!”
  </p>

  <p>
    Harry was rather silent on the way home, but showed the course of his
    thoughts by remarking: “I think perhaps I will give up being anything
    too civilized; I’m going to ask my father to buy me a ranch far out
    West.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I wonder,” said Mr. Douglass, “whether the young Indians who come to
    the Fair with the Indian schools ever go to see the Wild West Show?”

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">On</span> Tuesday morning the party hurried through their breakfast in order
    to catch the tally-ho which was to pause in its mad career to pick
    up passengers from their hotel. Although it was a cloudy morning,
    threatening rain, they did not like to postpone this trip again.
    Consequently ten o’clock, the hour set, beheld them “all agog to dash
    through thick and thin” like John Gilpin.
  </p>

  <p>
    Presently something drew up at the door. It was not what would be
    called by the critical a tally-ho. It was not even a coach. It was
    on wheels, it had seats here and there, and four animals dragged it.
    Baron Munchausen once had his horse cut close off by the fall of a
    portcullis. If the same accident had befallen a tally-ho, and it had
    been then spliced to the end of a park wagon, the resulting vehicle
    would have been not unlike the wagon which presented itself at the
    door.
  </p>

  <p>“Is this it?” asked Mr. Douglass, dubiously presenting his ticket.</p>

  <p>
    “This,” said the man (he was hardly yet a voter), “is it. Yes, sir.
    The tally-ho, sir.”
  </p>

  <p>“Well,” remarked Mr. Douglass, turning to the boys, “what do you say?”</p>

  <p>
    “We’d better go,” said Harry. “It’s all arranged; and the wagon looks
    comfortable anyway. Don’t you say so, Phil?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Yes,” said Philip. “It’s no tally-ho, but I don’t know as that makes
    any great difference. It has wheels, and—horses,” after a pause.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">156</span></p>

  <p>
    Having taken outside seats, they climbed up on the wheel-hub and two
    steps, and were soon perched some ten feet above the ground ready to
    start. Just as they settled themselves in their places, a policeman
    came to the curb and spoke warningly to the driver, who said, “I
    can’t help it,” and gathered up the reins.

    Mr. Douglass, who was not used to fast riding, made up his mind that
    their lofty seat might be a risky place to sit, and was gratified
    to find a stout rail at the back of the seat, which afforded an
    excellent place to hold on. Harry, too, concluded that they would
    soon be tearing at breakneck speed through the crowded streets of the
    city, and began to think he had been unjust to the “tally-ho.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “We’re off!” said Philip, as the horses heaved at the traces and the
    wagon changed its place leisurely: At a slow walk they drew the wagon
    around the corner and stopped at another hotel. A man who seemed to
    be in charge alighted and entered the door. That was the last seen
    of him for a considerable period. Queries to the driver were smiled
    away. They waited and waited. Nothing happened. After their patience
    was gone, the missing man came back, and the coach floated on.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    “Now we’re started!” said Mr. Douglass, with an expression of relief.
    But the coach rounded a corner in a leisurely manner, and drew up
    at another hotel. Again the man disappeared, and the waiting was
    repeated.
  </p>

  <p>
    “This is not a tally-ho,” said Harry, “it is a tarry-whoa”; and so
    it proved. Even after the man was again at hand, the old coach went
    no faster than the slowest of jog-trots. And at the same dolorous
    gait they<span class="pagenum">157</span> loitered along on Woodlawn Avenue, a straight street
    beautifully paved, and fit to be a blessing to bicyclers. They were
    as long in passing a given point as was possible. Every vehicle
    went by them except children’s carriages with nurses; wagons of
    heavy iron-castings, dirt-carts, streetcars—until one man remarked
    jocosely that he was afraid a funeral might come up behind and run
    over them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then Harry remembered the policeman who spoke to the driver just as
    they were starting, and a light dawned upon that mystery.
  </p>

  <p>“You remember that ‘cop’ who talked to our driver?” he asked Philip.</p>

  <p>
    “Yes,” said Philip; “I thought he was warning him against reckless
    driving.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “So did I,” said Harry, laughing. “But I’m sure now that he
    was saying a word for the poor horses. Why, those Fifth Avenue
    stage-horses they make such fun of in New York are Arabian coursers
    compared to these! See them creep!”

  <p>
    They passed some gray stone buildings on the way to the business part
    of the city, and the driver said they were the Chicago University—a
    statement they accepted at the time, but doubted when they became
    better acquainted with the driver’s acquirements as a guide. Another
    great establishment they saw was an old field crowded with tents and
    labeled “Camp Jackson.” A sign upon its rainbow-tinted fence informed
    the public that board in that field and under those tents was two
    dollars a week and thirty-five cents a day.
  </p>

  <p>
    “It’s a comfort,” said Harry, “to reflect that all these places,
    rough as they are, mean to offer Fair accommodations.”
  </p>

  <p>
    At another time this weak pun would not have been noticed, but upon
    that weary, slow ride anything was a relief: when the horses stopped
    to drink, it was an event; when a new passenger got on (one did), the
    excitement was intense. But nothing hastened the wagon. It meant to
    get to Chicago if it took all day; and after awhile they did begin
    to see buildings more closely set, and then they entered a beautiful
    park. The driver said it was Washington Park, and on consulting a
    map afterward,<span class="pagenum">159</span> the boys made up their minds that he had guessed
    right—there were some things the driver knew.
  </p>

  <p>
    The park was flat as a board, as is all the country for miles around;
    but as the ground was mainly given up to beautiful green lawns
    extending as far as one could see, the effect was excellent, and
    marred only by some very florid designs laid out in colored plants.
    One of these designs formed a sun-dial, called “Sol’s Clock”; another
    showed a few bars of “Hail Columbia.”

  <p>
    Even Mr. Douglass had now given up his visions of dashing along to
    the sound of a “yard of brass,” and so far from being at all nervous,
    would not have been afraid to stand upright in any part of the
    coach. He kept thinking of a parody upon Shakspere’s description of
    the school-boy: “A tarry-whoa, creeping like snail, unwillingly to
    Chicago.” By this time they were in Michigan Avenue,—a thoroughfare
    with beautiful grass plots along the street, but houses that did not
    please an architect who was also on top of the coach. He declared
    all but a few of the houses to be fussy and tiresome; and the boys
    noticed that those he commended were plain and simple in their
    outlines, and little decorated.
  </p>

  <p>
    At Twenty-second Street, they saw the Chicago street-cars, and found
    that they ran in trains of three coupled together, an arrangement
    of which they heartily approved. As they passed a baker’s cart, a
    small boy leaned out and whipped the horses of their coach; whereupon
    several of the passengers thanked him warmly, even though his efforts
    produced, no result. Still, in time they did reach the city, and
    recognized the lofty Auditorium, an<span class="pagenum">160</span> enormous pile of stone, so many
    stories high that the boys lost count in attempting to reckon them.
    Soon after they admired the Art Institute, “a broad and low building
    of impressive design.” They also saw the foundations being laid for
    another great building, and remembered having read in <cite><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas</cite>
    that these heavy structures could be supported only upon artificial
    foundations, such as long piles driven deep into the soft ground. The
    Masonic Temple was also seen as they passed through the busy part of
    the city.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was a smoky smell in the air, and their first impression was of
    being down-town in Broadway, New York, when a great fire was raging,
    filling the air with smoke. Possibly the smoke was worse than usual,
    for rain was falling at intervals and the air was heavy.

  <p>
    None of them talked much, for the slow drive was anything but
    enlivening. They went along Lake Street for some time, and then
    wandered on until they drew up at the Waterworks. Here, despite the
    protests of the passengers, there was a halt of five minutes, and
    some got out and went in to see the machinery. When all were on
    board again, the scenery slowly changed, and they found out that
    they were in motion once more. But as they had reached the Lake
    Drive,—a beautiful boulevard, and one of the system of drives that
    encircles the city, connecting Chicago’s great parks into a ring
    of pleasure-grounds,—the slow driving was not so irritating. They
    saw Mr. Potter Palmer’s castellated mansion fronting the lake, and
    passing other fine dwellings, reached Lincoln Park.
  </p>

  <p>
    Against the sky, in silhouette, appeared the statue of General
    Grant, an impressive feature of the park, and they were sorry that
    their route did not bring them within view of the even finer Lincoln
    statue, of which they had seen many pictures. Looking forward along
    the drive, they saw a dark point of land along the horizon beyond the
    lake, and were told by the rather taciturn driver that it was the
    city of Milwaukee, which information surprised them quite as much as
    if he had said it was Bagdad. “Traveling certainly makes one modest,”
    said Mr. Douglass, who doubted the driver’s statement. “I had no
    thought of seeing Milwaukee upon this drive.”

    Another statue of a man in an old-style curled wig was seen, and
    the driver told them it was Linn. Even the tutor had never heard of
    Linn, and all remained puzzled until a turn in the road showed the
    inscription “Linné,” whereupon they recognized Linnæus. Though they
    hated to lose the invaluable information the driver was giving them
    in homeopathic doses, they were glad when the coach worked its way to
    the front of a park restaurant, and announcement was made that there
    would be a halt of an hour or more for lunch.

    “Mr. Douglass,” said Philip, “I don’t know how you feel, but my feet
    are as cold as ice, and I’d rather get off and walk.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Oh, let’s walk!” Harry chimed in. “I’d rather ride in a canal-boat
    than to stay in this old coach any more.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “So would I,” said Mr. Douglass. “I consider this ride a regular
    swindle. See here!” he went on, turning to the driver’s accomplice,—a
    young man who rode inside,—“what is the matter with this conveyance?
    We’ve crept all the way out. Are you going any faster?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “No, sir,” answered the young man, turning State’s evidence and
    revealing the whole secret; “the fact is, those horses—look at
    ’em!—are all played out. They’ve been going over this road for
    months, and they’re played out.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “We have had enough of it,” said the tutor, a little sharply, “and
    we’ll walk.”
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">163</span></p>

  <p>
    “I don’t blame you,” the young man answered, as if he would have
    liked to join them.

  <p>
    Leaving the park, they inquired how to get back into the business
    center of the city, and were told to take the cable-cars. These
    proved to differ in some ways from New York cars, and one feature
    seemed worthy to be copied. At the ends of each car the side seats
    ceased, leaving a clear floor all across the car near the door, so
    that those who were compelled to stand should not obstruct the middle
    aisle at the doorway.
  </p>

  <p>
    “That’s a good idea,” Philip remarked, as he pointed out the
    arrangement to Harry; “for I’ve often noticed how people are sure to
    stand right in the doorway, blocking up the passage.”
  </p>

  <p>
    When they were near the end of their trip, the cars ran underground
    through a whitewashed tunnel, and the boys made up their minds that
    they were either running under the river or under the railway-tracks.
  </p>

  <p>
    “It’s about time for lunch,” said Mr. Douglass, looking at his
    watch; and turning to a young man beside him, he asked where there
    was a good lunch-room. The young man recommended one, and they felt
    grateful to him afterward. It was a large establishment, containing
    several kinds of lunch-rooms. They went into the “business man’s
    lunch-room,” and had an excellently cooked meal at a fair price.

    Until it was time to take the steamer, they wandered about the city
    looking at the more notable buildings and enjoying the sensation
    of being in a strange place. The great wholesale stores were like
    those in parts of New York, but New York had nothing just like some
    of the lofty buildings of more than twenty stories. Harry said
    that if there were two or three streets like Broadway and running
    across one another, or if Broadway were cut off in sections and
    laid criss-cross, the result would resemble Chicago. They saw the
    Auditorium again, and the Chamber of Commerce building, as well as
    some others; but the rain was unpropitious to sight-seeing, and they
    soon determined to make their way toward the “Whaleback” steamer. Of
    course they went wrong at first, for Chicago is a puzzling place to
    strangers, and Harry had to ask a big policeman for directions. He
    was hardly old enough yet to have lost his awe of “cops,” and felt
    relieved when the officer showed himself courteous and obliging. From
    what he had read of Chicago distances, Harry would not have been
    surprised to have been told he must “go fifteen miles south, then
    take a cable-car four miles west”; but their destination proved to be
    not so very far away.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <div class="caption">A STREET BRIDGE ACROSS THE CHICAGO RIVER, SWUNG OPEN

  </div>

  <p>
    Another cable-car rattled them down to Van Buren Street, and they
    found themselves, after a short walk, upon the dock awaiting the iron
    vessel so aptly named “Whaleback.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The boys were struck with her likeness, as she came close along the
    dock, to some of the dug-out canoes they had seen at the great Fair.
    They learned, however, from their friend the architect (whom they
    met again on the pier) that the boat was seaworthy, carried a large
    cargo, and was very fast, going even twenty-two miles an hour.
  </p>

  <p>
    Going aboard, they found her divided into three decks, and very
    finely fitted up. The second deck, which was even with the top of
    the hull, had walks along the curved sides of the vessel; for these
    “tumbled home” so as to be almost level.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the cabin, Harry found a phonograph which was advertised to sing
    his favorite “The Cat Came Back”; and he persuaded Mr. Douglass to
    try it. The tutor’s face, as the song began, lost its usual quiet
    expression, and soon he grinned quite as broadly as the small boy
    Harry had sketched at the Fair. Then the boys paid another five
    cents, and listened to a lively song called, “Drill, ye tarriers,
    drill”—wherein were introduced sounds of blasting, the singing, the
    orders of the boss, and all the features of work upon a railway
    excavation.
  </p>

  <p>
    But they wasted only a few minutes in the cabin, for the view of
    Chicago, as the boat steamed out, was well worth seeing. A few rays
    of sunshine struggled luridly through the heavy pall of dusky smoke
    that drifted over the city. Here and there great buildings or towers
    rose above the rest, but<span class="pagenum">166</span> the whole effect was soft and hazy. It was
    a picture of the city that was sure to remain long connected in their
    minds with the name Chicago.

  </div>

  <p>
    The trip was not a long one, but Harry found time to pick up
    acquaintance with a young man from Indiana, and the two were soon
    pronouncing words for each other’s amusement. He found Harry’s
    slighting of the letter R very droll, and told the New York boy that
    his mother had an aunt who was “a regular Yankee,” and said, “Why, I
    could listen to her talking all day; it does sound so queer!” Harry
    found the Indianian’s accent quite as strange, and said it reminded
    him of peculiarities he had noticed in the speech of Virginians.
  </p>

  <p>
    As they approached the long pier that extended out from the Fair
    Grounds, Philip began to be uneasy.
  </p>

  <p>
    “What’s the row, Phil?” Harry asked, noticing that his friend was
    frowning rather fiercely; “are you sorry to get back?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “The matter is this camera. I’ve got to take it through the grounds,”
    Philip replied.
  </p>

  <p>“I thought you had a permit for a week,” said Harry.</p>

  <p>
    “So I have,” replied Philip ruefully; “but it is at the hotel. I took
    the<span class="pagenum">167</span> camera along this morning, hoping that the weather would clear
    up so I could take something in the city; and I’ve been lugging it
    about all day without getting anything to speak of. Now here I am
    with no way to get to the hotel except by going through the Fair, and
    I haven’t got a permit.”
  </p>

  <p>“Whew!” Harry whistled. “Two dollars out!”</p>

  <p>
    But when Mr. Douglass came up, he was inclined to think there would
    be no trouble about the camera.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I’ll tell you what I should do,” he said. “Just walk along boldly,
    and if any one stops you, tell them the circumstances and then face
    the music.”

  <p>
    Just as Philip was going through the gate, one of the ticket-takers
    said, “Say, is that a kodak?”
  </p>

  <p>“Yes,” said Philip, “it is.”</p>

  <p>“Have you a permit for it?”</p>

  <p>
    “Yes,” said Philip, “but it’s at my hotel. It’s good for a week, but
    I didn’t bring it to-day”; and he went on to explain just how matters
    stood, offering to do whatever was right. “But,” he said, “I’ll tell
    you one thing—I don’t want to pay two dollars just to carry this
    camera through the grounds on a cloudy day at five o’clock.”

  </div>

  <p>
    “I should think not!” said the man, laughing good-humoredly. “I’ll<span class="pagenum">168</span>
    find the inspector and see what he says”; and he walked out along the
    dock. In a few moments he came back saying, “It’s all right; take it
    in. The inspector says he couldn’t let you if it wasn’t after four
    o’clock. You won’t try for any pictures?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “No,” said Philip, much relieved; and away he went, feeling that
    honesty was the best policy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Walking through the Court of Honor just at dusk, they were again
    delighted with the appearance of the buildings in the soft evening
    light. The Peristyle was especially artistic, for they saw through
    the columns the heavy, curling black smoke of the “Whaleback,” as she
    set out on her return trip to the city. The gilt decorations upon
    graceful Machinery Hall shone brightly, and they had to stop and gaze
    around them with renewed delight.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    “Perhaps it is just as well that these buildings are not to be
    permanent,” Mr. Douglass remarked, as they walked on. “We like them
    all the better for knowing that they are, after all, mere bubbles of
    staff, blown to delight the eyes for a little while. The architect
    whom we met on the coach said to me, ‘Somebody hit the nail on the
    head when he called these Fair buildings an architectural spree—it
    has been a bit of fun for the architects to show in plaster what
    they could do in marble; but why can’t some of our cities make a
    similar smaller show in marble—say an ornamental building like this
    Peristyle, around a harbor?’”
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">169</span></p>

  <p>
    When they asked for the keys of their rooms, Mr. Douglass received
    also a letter. “Ah!” he said, “here’s the letter from your father,
    Harry. Come up into my room and we will read it.” The letter was as
    follows:
  </p>

  <blockquote class="clear mt5">
    <p class="rightinset">
      September 21, 1893.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Douglass</span>: When I telegraphed this morning, I was
      afraid you would think it strange unless I promised a letter. But now
      I sit down to write, I feel there is little to add to my despatch.
      I know Mr. Farwell will arrange business details, and that you will
      get safely to the Fair. I am sure you will know that I do not expect
      you to feed the boys on useful knowledge all the while you are in
      Chicago; but I should like Harry to look carefully after two things.
      I would like him to see the railroad exhibits, and to see the papers
      about Columbus. The latter is important, because there will never be
      so good a collection brought together again. The railroad exhibits I
      should like him to see, because I wish him to learn what an amount of
      skill and learning has gone into the modern railroad. Perhaps then
      the business will attract him, and I shall expect him to take it up
      when I must resign. As for Philip, he’ll learn more about the Fair by
      himself than any one can teach him.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think perhaps a fortnight should be enough to spend at Chicago; but
      as to that, use your own discretion. I hope that all three of you
      will enjoy the big show, and I’m sure you will be better Americans
      for having seen it.

      Tell Harry that his mother and I are well, and give him our love.

    “That’s just what I thought,” said Harry. “He wishes me to get into
    railroading, and that is one reason he sent me here. I see one thing;
    I have got to go through the Convent again. I hardly looked at those
    old documents.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “We have a few days yet,” said Mr. Douglass; “we will certainly go
    more carefully over those exhibits. I am glad to hear from your
    father, though I know his ideas well enough to have been very sure
    of his intention. I have still plenty of money, but I think that two
    weeks will be enough to give to the Exhibition. One could not exhaust
    it in years.”

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">Wednesday</span> Philip had set apart on his schedule for the Fisheries
    Building, intending to spend any spare time at some less important
    places near by. He had already found that it was well to save himself
    what bodily fatigue he could, and so he took a rolling-chair almost
    as soon as he entered the grounds, from a conical tent not far from
    the Pennsylvania Railroad exhibit. The man who pushed the chair told
    Philip he was from Finland; and a few attempts to converse with him
    were so fruitless that Philip gave up trying.
  </p>

  <p>
    He went first to the photographic room where he had left a roll of
    pictures to be developed. Then, after making the usual morning call
    for letters, he went on to the appointed building. On the way, the
    Finland guide woke up enough to show some interest in photography,
    asking Philip, “Do you take in colors the pictures yet?” Philip
    in reply gave a short account of the state of (what is called)
    color-photography, and the Finland guide was probably more muddled
    than ever.
  </p>

  <p>
    Philip had once or twice stepped into the Fisheries Building before,
    but so far had never been in the east wing, where the aquaria were
    situated; so he selected this part as a beginning. As usual, he
    had brought his camera, and right at the entrance he found a good
    subject—a young man who was perched upon one side of the steps.
    Philip “took” him, and then set himself to studying the decorations
    of the outside of the portico.
  </p>

  <p>
    The pillars supporting the arched doorway had in relief upon them
    forms of aquatic life, modeled life-size or larger, and arranged in
    geometrical<span class="pagenum">172</span> patterns. For instance, one pillar was covered with
    frogs arranged in diagonal lines crossing one another so as to form
    diamonds. Others in the same doorway showed turtles, snakes and
    lily-leaves, newts and crabs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Philip also saw that all of the ornamental work about the building
    was composed in the same way. He thought it amusing in a temporary
    building, but felt sure his friend the architect whom they met on the
    Whaleback would never have approved of the decorations if applied in
    equal profusion to a permanent building.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside the aquarium wing he found a circular corridor both side walls
    of which were made up of tanks filled either with salt or fresh
    water. To keep this water fresh and wholesome for the fish, spurts
    of water shot down through the surface from above, making a silvery
    fountain upside down at the top of each tank. There were no windows
    in the corridor, all the light coming through the water from the
    top of the tanks. This arrangement made that part of the building
    rather gloomy, but enabled the people to see the fish under the best
    possible conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    The people seemed to enjoy the show very much, and had none of that
    bored air with which they walked around some exhibits in other
    buildings. Each aquarium was like a show-case, and the light playing
    upon the moving fish caused them to glitter and shine. Philip heard
    one girl exclaim as she entered, “Um—um! How lovely!” and wondered
    for the hundredth time at the queer adjectives girls apply to what
    pleases them.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <div class="caption">CAPITAL IN FISHERIES BUILDING.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The building was jammed full. Judging from photographs he had seen,
    Philip was sure that in the earlier days of the Exposition there was
    a better opportunity for examining exhibits. Now, everywhere he went,
    there were such throngs of people that he found it difficult to use
    his note-book. Every time he entered a building, he found his camera
    a burden and a trouble; but no sooner was he out again than he was
    glad he had brought it with him.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here he had to fall into line if he wished to make any progress at
    all. People would gaze upon some slab-sided, pop-eyed fish until they
    entirely forgot they were keeping others away. Then the crowd would
    move forward with the gentle force of a glacier, and progress would
    begin again.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">SKELETON OF A WHALE.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The first tanks Philip saw held various sorts of bass, sturgeon,
    trout, and<span class="pagenum">173</span> pike. It was a strange sensation to see the fish so near,
    and so confined that they could not dart away. It gave one the idea
    that swimming in the sea was not so very different from flying in the
    air, except that a bird has to keep moving or descend, whereas the
    fish can stop where he pleases, and hang suspended as comfortably as
    Mahomet in his coffin, or more so.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">FLYING-FISH.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Other fish he saw were the sheepshead, who had the true sheepish
    expression; catfish, with their odd sparse whiskers; some strangers
    labeled “small-mouthed buffaloes” (Philip wondered how it would sound
    to go into a restaurant and order “a fried small-mouthed buffalo,
    please, for one”); something that was written down in his note-book
    as “red-horse”—but what the creatures were like, and what their true
    names might be, Philip had no recollection at all when he read over
    his notes. There were, though, some whose names did recall exactly
    their appearance,—the “short-nosed gars,” for instance, who had
    particularly long noses.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tank of goldfish was really “lovely,” for as one approached them
    the light shone upon them as brilliantly as if they had been sunset
    clouds. One visitor was so impressed with this fine display that he
    remarked with more feeling than logic, “It is wonderful what human
    flesh can do when<span class="pagenum">174</span> they put their heads together!” Philip laughed
    at this, and after having had his elbow joggled four or five times,
    succeeded in writing it down so that he hoped he could tell Harry
    about it.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    Harry and Mr. Douglass were at the other end of the grounds; for
    Harry, in view of his father’s letter, felt that he ought to go
    through the little convent, and Mr. Douglass found that end of the
    Fair full of interest.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was oppressively warm in the Fisheries Building, and Philip, often
    over-prudent, had carried his overcoat with him. He had heard so much
    before coming to Chicago of the “cold breezes from the lake,” that he
    hardly dared to enter the grounds without some protection. At first
    the coat was light enough, but as time went on it seemed that each
    moment dropped a leaden bullet into one of the pockets, and his arms
    ached though he changed the burden continually from one to the other.
    His camera he made use of as a desk, fastening his note-book to the
    top of it by putting a rubber band around one end, but the coat
    became a great nuisance before the tour was finished.
  </p>

  <p>
    In one tank he saw a queer turtle whose flippers were so broad that
    they reminded Philip of four fans on the ends of a frog’s “arms” and
    legs. The<span class="pagenum">175</span> sand-pike, the golden ide (“A queer way to spell it!”
    said an old lady), and the Missouri catfish occupied more tanks,
    and claimed Philip’s attention in their order. The last tank of the
    outside row was filled with minnows,—such as boys call “shiners,”—and
    reminded him of a big bait-box.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then came salt-water fish, and the change in the color and clearness
    of the water was very noticeable. It was much harder to see the
    fish, and when they scooted off to the other side of the tank, they
    were lost to view. The lobsters had a sort of pile of rocks to which
    they clung fast, and the crabs also seemed disinclined to move
    about. When he came to a tank labeled “sea-robins,” it was some time
    before Philip could see why the queer little fish were so called.
    At last, when one came near, he noticed a red spot beside its head,
    and concluded that this accounted for the name. One of the oddest
    specimens he saw was called the “paddle-fish.” It had a long flat
    nose extending out flat forward—probably it was used by the fish as
    a sort of shovel to stir up the sandy or muddy ground where its food
    was found.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    Philip wondered what the fish thought of their queer situation.
    Instead of having the whole ocean to roam through, they found
    themselves in narrow quarters around which great animals with staring
    eyes pressed continually.<span class="pagenum">176</span> They did not seem at all frightened, and
    had probably given up their situation as a problem the solution of
    which was not meant for them to know. At least they must have found
    some satisfaction in the absence of the enemies who usually chased
    them about without regard for Sundays or holidays. Philip, who was
    of a speculative turn of mind, wondered how it would seem to men
    if lions and tigers might at any moment come around the corner to
    devour them. He hoped that the fish were less sensitive, or he was
    sure their lives in the ocean would be so unbearable that they would
    commit suicide by leaping out on shore.

  <p>“Oh, no, they ain’t.”</p>

  <p>“Oh, you go ’way; I guess I know!”</p>

  <p>
    The scientific discussion given above had proceeded no further when
    a cooler-headed member of the party pointed with a peace-making
    finger to the label, which read “Catfish,” as plain as print. Hoping
    that these visitors’ knowledge of fishes had been improved by this
    little difference of opinion, Philip found that he had exhausted the
    contents of the outer corridor, and went into the middle, where he
    found a rockwork fountain surrounded by a pool full of other fish. He
    went around the tanks seen from the middle of the building with the
    same care he had given to those outside, and found plenty to pay him
    for the trouble.

  <p>
    In one compartment were several sharks, and affixed to one of the
    sharks were two of those fishes called “remoras,” who have upon their
    heads a sort of sucker that can be used to hold them to any smooth
    surface. Philip remembered reading that the ancients thought these
    fish could stop even a large galley. He had always regarded the
    statement as a wild yarn of antique romancers, but he was glad to see
    just how the remora applied himself to his vocation. The shark was
    unable to get at his unwelcome guests, and there were two of them,
    each more than half as long as his host.<span class="pagenum">178</span> Philip said to himself
    that it was a shame, and then he happened to think that it was not
    necessary to be very sorry for sharks—which are not a kindly race.
    What the remora had to gain by this attachment he couldn’t exactly
    see, unless it was mere transportation from place to place. Possibly
    the shark would leave something of every meal, and then the remoras
    would dine at the second table. It was as if a banker should have
    two professional beggars sit upon his shoulders, and pick up the odd
    change that he didn’t look sharply after.

  <p>
    The next remarkable fish that attracted his eye—or rather, repelled
    it—was the file-fish. This creature, if it <em>was</em> the file-fish, had a
    strong family resemblance to an unequally cooked and lumpy buckwheat
    cake, and was hardly thicker. It was an animated pancake swimming
    edge up. But what interested Philip was its method of propulsion.
    Along its back ran a fin for nearly the fish’s whole length, and this
    fin waved in a curving line like the path of a serpent. Philip had
    heard Harry wonder why ships were not propelled by some such device,
    and he resolved to tell his cousin that Nature was ahead of him in
    using that means of going through the water.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then Philip walked along the curving corridor with ornamented
    columns<span class="pagenum">179</span> that led to the main building. Just as he entered this part
    of the central hall, he saw a clever bit of advertising. It was
    headed, “They say it’s hot in Southern California,” and below was a
    statement of the daily temperature contrasted with that of Chicago.
    For that day the California temperature was 67° as contrasted with
    Chicago’s 73°.

  </div>

  <p>
    Philip did not find this main building as interesting as the aquarium
    part. There were many models of fish, but they seemed very tame
    after the live ones. In the Netherlands exhibit (as, indeed, in most
    of them) was a model fishing-boat, but Philip did not know enough
    entirely to comprehend the purpose of the different devices shown,
    so he gave them only a glance. The exhibits of nets were likewise of
    small interest to him, though a fisherman would, no doubt, have been
    long entangled in their meshes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The red disk on a white field that again marked the Japanese show
    promised him more entertainment, and he entered the inclosure. Here
    he found several fine little models, the most novel being that
    displaying the method of fishing with cormorants. A little boat full
    of fishermen was upon the painted waves, and in the bow was a torch
    made of an iron basket wherein flamed some material that had been
    soaked in oil. In the model this was represented by dyed wool. Each
    fisherman held in his hand a cord fastened to a ring fixed tightly
    around a bird’s neck. The birds were swimming about and diving for
    fish. When a fish was caught, the bird was hauled in, deprived of his
    prey, and sent out to try again.

    There were in cases different kinds of fish-hooks, twisted and turned
    into all European shapes, besides some eccentric ones of their own,
    spoons and other devices for trolling, snells and lines, not very
    different from those used in America and Europe. Their sail-boats
    differed, however, from ours in the way the sails were made. Instead
    of being in one piece, the sails were in perpendicular strips
    fastened together by a network of cords so as to leave open spaces.
  </p>

  <p>
    Philip saw a young Japanese (he looked young, but may have been
    fifty) who was eating lunch in a corner of the room, and asked him
    the reason of this arrangement. “To hold wind less,” he said; but
    the American boy was not quite satisfied, for he could not see why a
    smaller sail would not meet the same need. He thought it more likely
    that the sails were so made in order to stow away more easily. The
    Japanese boy saw nothing queer in the boats, but Philip’s camera was
    to him a great wonder, and he politely asked an explanation of its
    working. This Philip gave, and<span class="pagenum">182</span> took the little Jap’s picture in
    the course of his lecture on cameras. He also gave the foreigner a
    memorandum of the name and price of the camera, whereupon courteous
    Japan presented a catalogue of the exhibit and a business card.

  <p>
    In the main hall the State of Washington had hung an enormous
    “humpbacked whale” skeleton nearly forty-eight feet long, and
    showed the jaws of another as a gateway to its inclosure. Norway
    showed great harpoons and guns to project them. Baltimore, Ireland
    (a critical passer-by said, “How very Irish to have a Baltimore in
    Ireland!”), showed a model fishing-school, a set of tiny buildings
    with little dolls at work making nets. The dolls’ idiotic faces took
    away all likeness of the exhibit to nature; and Philip, just from the
    tiny Japanese fishermen, so perfectly modeled, thought the difference
    spoke strongly in proof of the artistic sense of Japan.
  </p>

  <p>
    Philip examined the models of German fishing-craft, and was
    particularly curious to know about a small boat moored to
    a tiny tree, one of three trunks below the surface of the
    water. He consulted the label, and found<span class="pagenum">183</span> out that this was a
    “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Miesmuschelzucht in der Kieler Bucht</i>,” and with that information
    written down carefully he departed, satisfied to wait until he had
    more time and a German dictionary.

    More netting exhibits—“strings and things”—did not long delay Philip,
    who had caught sight of the space covered with green cloth where
    Gloucester, Massachusetts, had arranged her boats and buildings so
    that one could understand how they contributed to the comfort of
    mankind and themselves. A lobster-packing house had made the same
    attempt to inform the world just how the poor lobster came to be
    caught, canned, and sent to table; but here some cheap dolls again
    marred the effect of the well-made apparatus.
  </p>

  <p>
    North Carolina showed a “rush camp,” a round hut of rushes in which
    had been put the proper fittings to show what accommodations their
    fishermen made for themselves. Mexico had a display that may have
    been worth seeing, but Philip noticed the fence only, which was
    a clever bit of work. As he left the Fisheries Building, he felt
    that, like the others, its display was too good and too full to be
    appreciated by any but experts—for whom, probably, it was especially
    prepared.
  </p>

  <p>
    He felt sure that every man or boy who went to the Fair saw some
    device or method that he would either adopt or improve in his own
    work. With a people so quick of apprehension and so inventive as
    Americans, the benefits arising from the World’s Fair must be beyond
    exaggeration.
  </p>

  <p>
    After leaving the Fisheries, Philip made up his mind to give the
    Government Building a good two hours of his day. He had passed
    through it several times, but he had never examined thoroughly the
    guns and wax Indians and mail-wagons which seemed especially provided
    for the delight of boys. Now he was glad that he had saved up the
    pleasure.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Government Building was as crowded as the Fisheries had been, but
    Philip pressed slowly along, catching sight first of a fishing-boat
    and the figures of two men in it arranging their shad-nets. The
    Patent-office exhibit, which he had promised himself much joy in
    looking over, he found almost too confusing, as had Harry before him.
    So he passed quickly through this section and reached the exhibit of
    the Post-office Department, where one could see at a glance every
    possible way of carrying the mail, from an old stage-coach to the
    latest mail-car.

    The Smithsonian Institution and the Ordnance Department of the United
    States Army exhibited what Philip felt were really just the most<span class="pagenum">185</span>
    interesting things he had seen in the whole Fair. The groups of wax
    Indians, the great guns, the army-wagons, and the dog-sledges were
    surrounded by groups of delighted people of all ages.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then Philip decided that he would go to the Japanese tea-house,
    taking in the beautiful model Japanese house on the Wooded Island. He
    found the model house, but it took him fully twenty minutes to find
    the tea-house, with four consultations of his map; and while seeking
    it he saw the Brazilian Building for the first time, although he must
    have passed it again and again. This will give some idea of the size
    of the Fair, for that building is 140 feet high, 148 feet long, and
    of equal width.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the Japanese tea-house Philip sat upon a wicker stool, and
    received a cup of “ceremonial tea,” a half-pound of the tea, a wafer,
    some sweetmeats, a souvenir, and elaborate courtesy. He also received
    a ticket entitling him to enter the tea-houses where the cheaper tea
    was served. After a long rest within this pretty inclosure, Philip
    took the electric launch to the southern part of the park, where he
    wandered about, taking an occasional snap-shot, until he felt his
    legs would no longer submit to be imposed upon. He went home very
    weary; but he was getting used to that.

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">As</span> has been said, Harry and Mr. Douglass set out for the Convent of
    Santa Maria de la Rábida, which means “Blessed Mary of the Frontier,”
    according to the wise men who write guide-books. Appropriately built
    upon a point of land, it was surrounded by green turf to the shore,
    where pointed rocks made an irregular wall. Even to one coming
    through the Court of Honor—an architectural display unequaled—the
    quiet little convent presented an aspect of quaint simplicity that
    was full of dignified repose. Its plain walls and low-pitched roof
    were relieved only by two features that broke the sky-line, a tower
    and a belfry. Probably its designers thought little or nothing of
    architectural beauty, and had attained their object when they had
    made an inclosed court surrounded by small rooms, with one or two
    large enough for a refectory and chapel.
  </p>

  <p>
    Entering a narrow doorway at the back, Mr. Douglass and Harry found
    themselves in a large hall, which was no doubt the chapel of the
    original building. To their right was the place where the altar had
    stood, but in the model this inclosure contained pictures on the
    walls. They were very old, no doubt; but when a Columbian guard told
    an inquirer that they were “more than a thousand years, I guess,” Mr.
    Douglass and Harry concluded that the guard’s uniform was no guaranty
    of his knowledge.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">THE ORIGINAL CONVENT OF LA RÁBIDA, IN SPAIN.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    In the front of this chancel was an easel sustaining a frame that
    protected the commission authorizing Christopher Columbus to go and
    see what he could find. A placard requested “gentlemen to remove
    their hats,” as<span class="pagenum">188</span> Philip had said; but the American public had made
    up its mind to disregard this inscription. Mr. Douglass said to
    Harry, in a low tone, “I can see no reason for removing one’s hat to
    a piece of paper with ink on it. One can show a proper respect and
    appreciation for a relic without flunkeyism.” And Harry quite agreed
    with him.
  </p>

  <p>
    The commission was a bit of brown parchment written in a crabbed
    hand, probably by some court copyist; and not even the signatures
    were intelligible. Moving onward through the crush of people, they
    came next to the west wall, where there was a glass case containing
    the rarest ancient treatises upon geographical matters. There were
    twenty or thirty in the case, some ornamented with woodcuts; but
    though Harry had come with the best of intentions to study the
    exhibits carefully, he could do nothing but gaze wonderingly at the
    type, saying to himself, “This is an old, old book. Columbus may have
    read it. Here’s another. What a queer picture!” At length he said to
    Mr. Douglass:
  </p>

  <p>“What do you make of them, Mr. Douglass?”</p>

  <p>
    “Very little, I must confess,” said the tutor. “One has to read such
    books to learn how much wheat there is amid the chaff of fable,
    folly, and guesswork. Even if I could read all the languages, I could
    get little from the<span class="pagenum">189</span> two pages which are all they can show. All you
    can do now, Harry, is to get a good idea of what these old books and
    charts are like. Perhaps we can buy a catalogue which will give us
    translations of some parts of the books and of the letters that are
    also shown here.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “What can one learn from these old books?” asked Harry. “Surely there
    is nothing in them that we don’t know about.”
  </p>

    <div class="caption">THE CONVENT OF LA RÁBIDA AT THE FAIR.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    “No, of course there isn’t,” said the tutor. “We can only take
    an interest in them as showing the beginning of events that have
    resulted so wonderfully. It is also true that now and then we find a
    sentence throwing light upon how men did things in old times. But it
    is rather as a matter of curiosity than of learning that these relics
    are studied.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Upon the west wall was a very large painting showing the “Landing.”
    It represented Columbus, just after he had stepped ashore, raising
    his eyes upward in thanksgiving for his success. The men in the
    boat seemed to show curiosity and enjoyment rather than piety. The
    painting was not remarkable except that the expression upon the
    discoverer’s face was well rendered.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the left of the picture the original anchor of the wrecked “Santa
    Maria” leaned against the wall. Both flukes were gone. Mr. Douglass
    felt a little<span class="pagenum">190</span> doubtful of the genuineness of this relic, but was
    willing to be convinced. There seemed to be no proof that the anchor
    belonged to the old caravel; but, on the other hand, it was found
    where her anchor might have been, and it was pleasant to believe
    that it might be the very piece of iron upon which the hand of the
    discoverer had often rested.

    <div class="caption">CELL OF THE PRIOR MARCHENA IN THE ORIGINAL
    CONVENT,—THE “COLUMBUS ROOM” IN THE MODEL AT THE FAIR.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Mr. Douglass asked a young man who was selling catalogues whether
    he hadn’t one telling just what letters and papers were in the
    building; but, to the tutor’s disappointment, the catalogues of the
    old manuscripts were all sold. There were a number of old paintings
    around the walls, but after examining a few, Mr. Douglass advised
    Harry not to waste much time over them, as their connection with
    Columbus was rather remote.
  </p>

  <p>
    Going up the narrow stairway, they came out upon a corridor that
    looked upon the open court through graceful arches; and from this
    corridor opened small square rooms—originally the monks’ cells. The
    doors were as plain as possible, and each had a latch lifted by a
    string coming out through a hole in the door; the windows were small
    and square, embrasured, or sunk, into the thick walls.
  </p>

  <div class="figright">

    <div class="caption">HOUSE IN GENOA SAID<br />
    TO BE THE BIRTHPLACE<br />OF COLUMBUS.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Various relics were hung at every point, either along the corridor or
    in the cells. Many of them were queer drawings or paintings, meant to
    show the manners and customs of the Indians; others were charts and
    maps, some earlier than Columbus and others later.
  </p>

  <p>
    At one place Harry suddenly stopped and pointed delightedly out of
    the little window.
  </p>

  <p>“See!” he cried. “Isn’t that just right?”</p>

  <p>
    Mr. Douglass turned, and gazing through the little opening saw the
    “Santa Maria” lying near the wharf opposite.
  </p>

  <p>
    “It makes one feel as if he were back four hundred years,” said the
    tutor, quite as much delighted with this fortunate view as Harry was.
    “Looking through this little window, we see nothing of the crowd, and
    are all alone with the convent and the caravel.”
  </p>

  <p>
    They were most interested in the “Columbus Room,” which occupied the
    place of the cell where lodged the monk who became interested in the
    man with a theory. There were dozens of portraits of Columbus, and
    they certainly gave one plenty of choice. Broad-faced, narrow-faced,
    round, oval, bearded, or smooth, the great discoverer might well have
    been puzzled to know which was his likeness. People’s remarks were
    droll enough.
  </p>

  <p>
    One young woman who had been critically scrutinizing the array of
    “Columbuses, various,” finally stopped delightedly before a large
    portrait and exclaimed:
  </p>

  <p>“Oh!—<em>that’s</em> more like him!”</p>

  <p>
    Harry longed to ask how she knew that, but concluded it would get him
    into trouble. Harry himself had no choice. He felt just as another
    critical visitor did. This was a young man in a broad felt hat, who
    sailed around the room, and left with the parting remark:
  </p>

  <p>“There isn’t one of them that looks alike!”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">192</span></p>

  <p>
    Mr. Douglass and Harry spent a long morning in the convent, but Harry
    wearied of it. He tried to be interested, for he wished to please his
    father; but he couldn’t find anything to take hold of in making a
    beginning. Still, by sitting quietly in the rooms and corridors, the
    boy, without realizing it, carried away a perfectly clear idea of the
    old convent, its arrangement, how Columbus must have been lodged and
    entertained, what the old documents were like, and how much modern
    maps differed from the rude charts of the Middle Ages.
  </p>

  <p>
    He told Mr. Douglass that he couldn’t make much of it; but the tutor
    consoled him.
  </p>

  <p>
    “You never know how much you have learned until long after you’ve
    studied and gone past a subject,” said Mr. Douglass. “Some day you’ll
    read more about this old building and its documents, and then you’ll
    find a peg to hang the knowledge upon. Have you ever seen a negro
    minstrel try to hang his hat on a wall where there is no hook?”
  </p>

  <p>Harry laughed, and said he had.</p>

  <p>
    “That is what people must do who have no general ideas to hang
    particular bits of information upon. Now, in this case you would
    be surprised to see how much you know about Columbus compared with
    what you knew before you came to this Fair. I won’t bother you now
    to review it; but some day, when we are studying again, I’ll let you
    note down the facts about Columbus that you learned at the World’s
    Fair.”
  </p>

  <p>“Thank you,” said Harry, smiling.</p>

  <p>
    “You’ll like to do it,” said Mr. Douglass. “You’ll see. Now let us
    take something a little simpler. I hear that the Cliff-Dwellers
    exhibit is really good. Suppose we go over there?”
  </p>

  <p>
    Harry was very glad to agree, and they walked still further southward
    past the Anthropological Hall and the Forestry Building,—a most
    interesting place, where none of them had yet been,—and came to
    the curious imitation of a great cliff which gave room to the
    Cliff-Dwellers museum and models.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here they found that there were guides to go about and explain the
    different parts of the show. They followed one of them for a while,
    but found that he talked so fast and paused so short a time in any
    place that they could hear and see little.
  </p>

  <p>
    Starting out upon their own account, they looked first at models
    built into the sides of the imitation rock,—for they were inside
    a great structure dimly lighted, and looking like a great
    cavern,—showing that the “villages” were really a collection of rooms
    made by erecting walls from floor to roof of a cleft in the cliff.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum">194</span></p>

  <p>
    Then they went into the museum, and saw relics of the strange people
    of whom little is known. Some believe there are no remnants of these
    Indian tribes of the Southwest. Others think the Pueblos are the same
    or a closely connected people.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">A LAMP.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    There were in the cases bits of sandals woven of cord, cloth
    remnants, some as finely woven as canvas; bits of bones, scooped out
    into spoons or sharpened and faced for needles; bits of straw hats,
    large stone mortars for grinding corn, the corn itself in jars and
    corn-cobs, and even skeletons, skulls, and mummies in a fair state of
    preservation. The skulls were finely developed in front, but nearly
    all flattened at the back. The skull of a Cree Indian was set in
    the case, in order to show how much finer were the foreheads of the
    Cliff-Dwellers. Harry was especially pleased to find a little bear
    made out of pottery,—a tiny little thing that was probably a toy. He
    made a sketch of it.
  </p>

  <div class="figright">
    <a id="i_207b"><img src="images/i_207b.jpg" width="175" height="57" alt="" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>
    Going into another part of the cavern-like structure, they saw some
    oil-paintings of the original rocks and dwellings from which these
    relics were taken. In yet another compartment were some of the
    donkeys used by the exploring party, and young girls and children
    took rides upon their backs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Harry was standing just at the heels of one of these little gray
    beasts of burden when a gentleman of an inquiring turn of mind asked,
    “Does he kick?” at the same time pinching the donkey to see. Luckily
    for Harry, the donkey didn’t kick, or there might have been a new
    mummy added to the collection in the museum.
  </p>

  <div class="figleft">

    <div class="caption">HARRY’S RESTORATION<br />OF A CLIFF-DWELLER.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Another place was set apart for full-size models of the houses, and
    it was curious to see how the walls surrounded a sort of fireplace.
    The Cliff-Dwellers apparently slept in stone bunks cut in the rock,
    for there were several of these mineral sofas around the walls.
  </p>

  <p>
    A path here and there led up out of the interior to the surface of
    the imitation cliff, and many people went clambering up and down
    these strange highways, clinging to ropes that had been fastened
    along the sides.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now and then the lecturing guide would come near enough to let Mr.
    Douglass and Harry hear part of his explanation. He spoke of the
    deep wells that supplied the dwellers with water; of the narrow
    trails that made the settlements inaccessible to the hostile tribes
    that drove this people from the fertile plains up into these rocky
    forts; of the lamps and the cooking-utensils: but all at such
    lightning-express speed<span class="pagenum">195</span> that Harry could find out nearly as much by
    examining the objects for himself.
  </p>

  <p>
    When they came out, Harry was amused to see that even the turnstile
    was made of rough logs, to be in keeping with its surroundings.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">THE CLIFF-DWELLERS’ MOUND.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    As Mr. Douglass intended to go out to see a procession of boats in
    the evening, they went home early. On their way they passed the
    Alaskan totem-pole settlement, but concluded not to make their way
    through the press in order to get into the hut where souvenirs
    were on sale. At the Indian village they did succeed in making
    their way within doors, but found nothing to repay them for their
    trouble—merely the regular array of baskets, bows and arrows, and
    similar trifles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some North African booths, kept by people of the French colonies,
    offered for sale all sorts of little trinkets in brass and silver
    filigree or cheap enamel; but in spite of the continued cry, “Sheep,
    sheep; everyt’ing werry sheep!” the party kept on toward the outlet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Reaching home, they found that Philip was already there. He was at
    the window, much amused over the doings of some of the negro waiters
    who, sitting around in the sunshine, were musically singing or
    talking over their experiences.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">196</span></p>

  <p>
    Philip displayed his photographs, and Harry showed the sketches he
    had made. But the party had ceased to be very talkative over the Fair.
  </p>

  <p>
    “What I should like to see,” said Mr. Douglass, “is a fair from
    which all the ordinary, commonplace exhibits are excluded. Cans
    and boxes of ordinary merchandise, even if piled up in ornamental
    forms, are better suited to an agricultural county fair than to a
    World’s Exposition. A small, choice exposition, where every exhibit
    was unique of its kind, would be more manageable and much better
    worth seeing. This Chicago World’s Fair has in it the very best
    material the world can produce. But it would take two years to see it
    thoroughly, and no one man could understand it then.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I’ll tell you what I should like to see,” said Harry; “and that is a
    grand procession where people of the same States should be in ranks
    together. Then we should see how they differed.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “And my idea,” added Philip, “is to have a Children’s Fair, where
    everything that is interesting to boys and girls should be on
    exhibition. That would be something like!”

  <p>
    “<span class="smcap">It</span> is interesting to reflect that the beginnings of all the marvels
    we shall see in this building,” said Mr. Douglass, as he walked
    with the two boys toward the Electricity Building, “are found in
    two trifling circumstances that the majority of men would have
    overlooked. Do you remember what led to electrical research?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I know,” said Philip, “that the word comes from the Greek for amber,
    and I suppose you mean the attraction of amber for little things was
    one of the two.”
  </p>

  <p>“Yes,” said Mr. Douglass. “Now what was the other?”</p>

  <p>
    “Frogs’ legs,” Harry answered. “I remember reading about that not
    long ago. Volta salted the frogs’ legs, thinking they were too fresh;
    and they kicked. That’s what you mean, isn’t it?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Exactly,” said Mr. Douglass, laughing. “And that frog-kick was the
    beginning of the impulse that laid the Atlantic cable. It was no
    doubt a great achievement to come upon a new world, as Columbus did;
    but really Volta, who knew exactly what he was about, deserves nearly
    as much credit. So you see that by carefully noticing what takes
    place in his own home in the course of his every-day life, a man may
    become renowned quite as well as if he braves the elements in search
    of a new continent.”
  </p>

  <p>“Do you think electricity will take the place of steam?” asked Philip.</p>

  <p>
    “No,” answered Mr. Douglass; “for, judging by the past, few really
    useful things are ever displaced. Every housekeeper still finds a
    need for candles, even where not only gas but electricity is at
    hand. The stage-coach is still built and used, though for different
    purposes than at first. We shall see to-day, in the Transportation
    Building, how many old inventions are yet on duty.”

  <p>
    As they entered they heard a sharp pounding, and saw a crowd
    gathered—the surest sign of something interesting—near a counter.
    Gradually making their way to the front, they saw a sign announcing
    that they could have their own coins made into Fair souvenirs,
    and found upon the counter small scarf-pins, medals, monograms,
    hair-pins, and paper-knives made from silver and nickel coins. The
    charge was only five cents, so Philip drew forth a half-dollar that
    he had been intending to spend on a present for his sister, and
    putting five cents with it, handed the coins over to the woman at the
    counter.
  </p>

  <p>“What would you like?” she asked.</p>

  <p>
    “A hair-pin like that,” said Philip, pointing to one that had 1893
    upon the top in openwork. The woman gave the half-dollar to the man
    at the stamping-machine, and he pushed it under the die. In a few
    moments Philip’s coin was transformed beyond recognition, and came
    out properly shaped and labeled “Columbian Exposition, 1893.” Harry
    satisfied himself with a nickel rolled into an oval and also stamped.

  </div>

  <p>
    A little further on they saw a counter where handkerchiefs were
    embroidered with appropriate inscriptions, also to serve as
    “souvenirs”—a word of which the party were becoming weary, as it was
    bawled, shouted, and whispered in their ears from morning until night.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many of the electrical exhibits were interesting only for
    their arrangement: there were, for instance, carbons arranged
    in geometrical patterns, and push-buttons forming letters and
    inscriptions.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was not until they had reached the southern end of the building
    that they began to think well of the electrical exhibition. But
    toward this end the attractions were most striking. There was a
    whirling ball of electric lights, hung near the ceiling, that Harry
    remembered noticing on the first evening,<span class="pagenum">200</span> when they had so much
    trouble to get in and out of this building. Not far from this ball
    was a column of colored-glass lamps, from the top of which lines of
    lamps ran zigzag over the ceiling, each ending in a hanging lantern.
  </p>

  <p>
    This column would suddenly gleam with colored fire at the base, then
    further up, then to the top, the waves of light dying out below as
    they ascended. Reaching the top of the column, the zigzag lines
    flashed out in wavy lightning flashes to the hanging lanterns. Then
    all would become dull, until another impulse made its tour of the
    line.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another beautiful exhibit was an Egyptian temple. The pillars were
    of roughened green glass lighted from within so as to glow like
    emeralds. The walls contained show-cases displaying electric fixtures.
  </p>

  <p>
    The boys had heard praises of the electrical theater situated in
    this corner of the building, and it was one of the places they had
    made up their minds to visit. But they found a line of people ranged
    before it, and extending back far enough to discourage any but an
    electrical crank. Reluctantly they withdrew, and went instead into
    the Greek temple, where a telephone was in working order. A row of
    young girls sat upon high stools facing a bewildering array of pegs.
    Upon their heads the girls each wore a light frame of metal bands
    that held telephones to their ears. It was a striking illustration of
    the line about “lend me your ears”; but in these modern days the ears
    are hired by the week. Every now and then one of the girls would lean
    forward and change a peg from one place to another.
  </p>

  <p>
    Besides the receiving instruments, a transmitter hung down just in
    front of the lips of each operator. In fact, every care was taken to
    enable these young women to hear all conversation addressed to them,
    and every facility given them to answer back.
  </p>

  <p>
    Harry said he thought it was just the sort of work a girl
    liked—nothing to do but to be talked to all day, with full liberty
    to talk back from a safe distance; but Mr. Douglass said that he had
    heard the work was very hard and exhausting.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the gallery they found a number of amusing or astonishing
    novelties. One that Philip found attractive was an electric
    boot-blacking machine. In front of chairs like those belonging to
    the regular “Have-a-shiners” of commerce, there were two brushes
    revolving rapidly. A man sat in the chair applying his well-developed
    foot to the brush, and receiving an electric shine that was nearly as
    good as the regular article.
  </p>

  <p>
    Harry watched this device critically, and at length said he didn’t
    like it.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Well, I do, then,” Philip answered. “Wouldn’t I like one to use
    every morning, though?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I mean that the principle isn’t right,” Harry insisted. “That
    inventor is making the man twist around so as to apply his foot to
    the brush. He ought to make an electric brush that can be held in the
    hand and put against the boot. Don’t you think so, Mr. Douglass?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Your argument seems reasonable,” said the tutor; “but it’s often
    wise to remember that the inventors have thought more about these
    problems than we have; so it is not likely they have overlooked the
    most evident criticisms. Still, in this case I think Harry is right.”

  <p>
    At another place in the gallery there was an electric door, and
    people were invited by placards to walk through it. It had a handle
    like other doors, but no one ever touched it; for no sooner did one
    approach than the door opened politely, closing after the person was
    upon the other side.
  </p>

  <p>
    One man—“who thought he was smart,” Philip said—walked up to the door
    as if he meant to pass through the doorway, and then halted. The door
    remained open so long as the man stood before it, and closed when he
    turned away.
  </p>

  <p>
    “It seems a pity to fool a door that is so polite,” Harry said.
    “Look,” he added; “there is a nice little girl trying it. See her
    laugh! It reminds her of ‘Alice in Wonderland.’”

  <p>
    Germany had a historical exhibit showing the earlier and cruder forms
    of dynamos; but the boys were not very well acquainted with dynamos.
    Mr. Douglass tried to explain how they worked; but after he found he
    had lost the trail of his ideas, he said frankly: “Well, I thought I
    knew the theory of dynamos and converters; but when I see the real
    machines here, they seem so much more complicated than the ones in
    the text-books that I find I don’t know the reason for many of the
    parts.”
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <div class="caption">AN EXHIBIT OF RAILS: MINING BUILDING.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The boys took more interest in the Western Union exhibit, where they
    saw Professor Morse’s earliest receiving instrument, and photographs
    of the original first message, “What hath God wrought!” The same
    words were affixed to the front of the pavilion, where not only the
    original instrument but the modern quadruplex system—a method of
    sending two messages each way, and all at once, on a single wire—was
    shown.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I wish,” said Harry, “that I could see the game of leap-frog these
    quadruped signals must play to get by on the same track!”
  </p>

  <p>
    Farther on were other German or Austrian exhibits, in one of which
    the boys saw a dome copied from that on some central telegraph
    station, and made up entirely of openwork so as to give room
    for hundreds of insulators. These insulators made up the curved
    surface of the dome, and the effect was<span class="pagenum">205</span> very decorative, while the
    arrangement must have been a great saving of space.
  </p>

  <p>
    What a lot of things there were besides! There was an electric
    cooking-apparatus where water was boiled upon a flat iron plate;
    there were clocks so contrived as to note the times a watchman
    touched a button on the front; there was Professor Gray’s
    telautograph, which merits some description.

    Holding a pen as in writing, the sender marks down his message, draws
    a design, inscribes his name—in fact, uses the pen as freely as if it
    had “no connection with the establishment across the way.” But two
    cords extend out from this pen and work an electric apparatus so as
    to pull two other cords or wires just as the first ones are moved: if
    he makes a mark down, the other pen is pulled down too; whatever one
    pen does, the other must do. Of course, then, any drawing or writing
    made upon one machine is also made on the other—no matter whether it
    is in the next room, the next county, or the next State. That is the
    telautograph—the name being Greek for “far-self-writer.”
  </p>

  <p>
    In the exhibit of the Commercial Cable Company were shown the method
    of writing messages in wavy lines, and bits of cable where the
    covering had<span class="pagenum">206</span> been injured, and the injury—sometimes no larger than a
    tack would make—traced and located many miles from shore by means of
    delicate tests.
  </p>

  <p>
    Down-stairs were great dynamos, electric cars, the Edison-light
    tower, which they had already seen in operation on their first
    evening at the Fair, and such an array of complicated measures,
    meters, and tests that the boys walked humbly out, feeling very small
    indeed as they passed the heroic statue of Benjamin Franklin in the
    portico. They felt that for the first time they understood how great
    a man was the printer’s boy who began by carrying two rolls under his
    arms and ended by carrying a thunderbolt under one arm and a scepter
    under the other.
  </p>

  <p>
    “But even he,” said Harry, as he jingled a pocketful of expensive
    souvenirs, “once paid too dear for his whistle.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The Electricity Building’s stocky twin, the Mining Exhibit, was right
    next door, and came next upon Philip’s neat list. But they did not
    intend to give a very long time to this building. They knew it to be
    full of minerals and mining machinery, and now felt small enough to
    admit there were two or three things in each display that they did
    not understand.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first distinct feature was the Stumm exhibit, which, behind
    a most imposing gateway of wrought-iron, showed rails and pipes
    in sizes ranging from mammoth to midget, built into two towering
    obelisks, and two trophies that resembled iron fountains. They
    gazed upon these with vague admiration, and then set out to find
    the Tiffany diamond show; they “found it, indeed, but it made their
    hearts bleed” to see the crowd piled three or four deep against every
    loophole and knot-hole where a wheel or a band was visible.
  </p>

  <p>
    The same result followed an attempt to inspect the Kimberley
    diamond-washing. They did see an enormous Zulu with embroidered
    suspenders pour a bucket of bluish mud into a great hopper, but
    though they lingered round in a most lamblike way, nothing else was
    to be observed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Iowa showed a life-size model of a coal-miner at work in his gallery;
    and at one glance the boys learned how it would feel to be “down in a
    coal-mine, underneath the ground, where a ray of sunlight never can
    be found.” They also enjoyed hearing and seeing the steam-drills, and
    gazed curiously at a model of “Lot’s wife,”—a woman built of salt,—in
    the Louisiana Exhibit. Various mines had sent models showing just how
    their galleries were built, and the boys inspected them critically.
    But they did not find very much to detain them in the Mining
    Building. Other people, too, seemed more interested in the souvenir
    stands than in the profusion of ores and stone blocks. Montana’s
    silver statue of Justice seemed to the boys more of a curiosity than
    a work of art, and they had no patience with the long arrays of
    machinery that meant nothing to them. Those who were<span class="pagenum">207</span> examining the
    exhibits were few, and the large crowds were watching the counters
    where small metal articles were plated, or were sitting in corners
    where they could rest themselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    A Columbian guard noticed that Philip had his kodak, and said, “You
    can’t take pictures in here; it’s not allowed.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I haven’t taken any,” said Philip; and then, as the guard seemed
    good-natured, he added, “I don’t see anything much to take. Why don’t
    they let you take things in here?”
  </p>

  <p>
    The guard grinned. “I’m sure I don’t know,” he said. “There doesn’t
    seem to be any sense in it.”

  </div>

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">From</span> the steps of the Mining Building the boys looked over toward
    the “Golden Doorway” of the Transportation Building, and made
    up their minds that it looked promising. By this time the white
    buildings had made them glad of the fancy harlequin costume worn by
    the autumnal-colored member of this interesting family. They liked
    even the angels painted along the walls, and as for the brakeman,
    “Mr. Land,” they thought he appeared to be a young fellow well worth
    knowing.
  </p>

  <p>
    So they entered with a readiness to enjoy whatever they should find.
    But they soon discovered there was no need to make excuses for the
    Transportation Building, and before long they carried out to the
    letter Harry’s punning prediction, “Now we shall go into transports!”
  </p>

  <p>
    They had missed so much at other times by leaving the galleries to
    the last that this time they went at once up the stairs. But on the
    landing they turned to take a view of the Lord Mayor’s Coach, an
    elegant turnout, as fine as a fiddle, which made the boys think at
    once of poor little Dick Whittington.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was Harry’s proposal to go into the gallery, and he was led to
    make it because there were set upon the gallery-railing two bicycles,
    ridden by dummy figures of a young man and a young woman. Harry liked
    bicycles, and meant some day to have “a beauty”; and he thought this
    was a good opportunity to get points.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">210</span></p>

  <div class="figleft">
    <a id="i_223"><img src="images/i_223.jpg" width="300" height="650" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">FIGURE OF BRAKEMAN,<br />TRANSPORTATION BUILDING.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    He got points; in fact, he picked so many points that he couldn’t
    remember them, for there were bicycles enough in the gallery to
    bend all the backs in a city into the letter “C.” But before
    examining these, the whole party were glad to give some time to Mrs.
    French-Sheldon’s camping-outfit and traveling sedan-chair. Shortly
    described, it was just a basket on poles, but it was sumptuously
    fitted up with cushions and awnings, and most ingeniously contrived
    so as to be light, comfortable, and convenient.
  </p>

  <p>
    “She’s the woman who collected all those odd things we saw in the
    Woman’s Building,” said Philip.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Yes, I remember reading about her in the papers,” said Harry. “She
    carried a fine silk dress with her, and always put it on when she
    received a native ruler. She seemed to think they liked it. But I
    have my doubts. I believe old Sultan Alkali Ben Muddy would grin when
    he was climbing back on his camel, and say to his first camel-driver,
    ‘The white woman is plucky, but I must say she puts on a lot of
    style!’”
  </p>

  <p>
    Really Harry could not help a feeling of great admiration for Mrs.
    French-Sheldon, and he would have liked to own a tent and palanquin
    of his own. Passing through a corridor of photographs showing
    “foreign scenes in New Jersey,” as they heard a jocular Irishman
    remark, they saw next an Indian ox-cart, heavy enough and clumsy
    enough to make any civilized Buck and Bright weep. Then came a
    tobacco-hogshead to which was attached a branched iron pole, so that
    the hogshead was its own wheel and cart in one.
  </p>

  <p>
    They heard a Southern girl say to her friend, “I’ve seen one just
    like that in Richmond.” But she hadn’t seen the next exhibit, for it
    was the<span class="pagenum">211</span> model of an antique chariot found near Thebes, and supposed
    to be a racing-sulky of such antiquity as to be labeled “the oldest
    vehicle known.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Harry, and indeed all three of the party, wondered at its beauty and
    elegant finish. It was made of some smooth-grained wood and rounded
    into exquisite curves. Harry made a hasty sketch of it, but had
    little hope that he could really draw its exquisite curves when he
    got home.
  </p>

  <div class="figright">

    <div class="caption">BIT OF ORNAMENT,<br />TRANSPORTATION BUILDING.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Then they went on, to be stopped by some African palanquins, fitted
    with carrying-poles, and, in sharp contrast to the Theban chariot,
    an African log-canoe so rude that it looked like the Missing Link’s
    private yacht. In close succession came vehicles for carrying such
    different articles as babies, dolls, and cash in dry-goods shops;
    but all were quite familiar to the New York boys. They found two
    “bicycle-railroads” more interesting, especially the one that hung
    from an overhead track.
  </p>

  <p>
    “It wouldn’t be surprising,” said Mr. Douglass, “if we should live
    to see those tracks put up over large sections of the land. For the
    bicycle is capable of displacing almost all passenger-carriers except
    in special cases. You see them here in this gallery so arranged as to
    be ridden by one, two, or three riders, so as to carry children with
    their parents, or fitted up for the use of firemen or soldiers.”
  </p>

  <p>
    At the end of a gallery they found figures showing how Mexican
    donkeys are loaded, men carrying chairs for transporting passengers
    over mountain-trails, and richly attired cavaliers mounted upon finer
    specimens of the same patient donkeys that carry panniers.
  </p>

  <p>
    An exhibition of leather saddles and similar wares brought them to a
    counter where whips were being covered by little bobbins revolving
    about as dancers whirl in the german. These whips were also for sale
    as sou—. “I wonder,” said Mr. Douglass, “that they didn’t offer to sell us the
    Cliff-Dwellers’ mummies as souvenirs. They certainly would outlast
    most of the cheap bric-à-brac offered for sale.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Japan showed in this building only a few models of engineering-works,
    and the boys did not give much time to her exhibit. They were most
    attracted by the smaller articles displayed on both sides of the
    galleries: an<span class="pagenum">212</span> English sedan-chair, such as they had seen in old
    paintings; a springless velocipede called the “Dandy Horse,” and
    dated 1810; the small model of an old stage-coach; a wonderfully fine
    model of Forth Bridge, Scotland, showing a miniature train of cars
    hardly thicker than a lead-pencil; a modern club canoe, side by side
    with barbaric outrigger canoes from the Friendly Isles (maybe).
  </p>

  <p>
    There was also a large model showing just what style of boat the
    fishermen used upon the Sea of Galilee in the days of the Saviour; it
    was a double-ended deep boat, looking as if it was very seaworthy,
    but gaudily painted.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Chamber of Commerce of the Port of Dunkerque, France, had sent to
    the Exposition an enormous reproduction of the town and harbors, so
    large that each house had its tiny model in the mimic town. The boys
    admired this exhibit, and concluded that the money and labor expended
    upon it would not be wasted; for if they had been merchants they
    knew that it would have been impossible for them to forget what an
    excellent place Dunkerque must be for trading.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another exhibit which they equally praised was that of a French
    steamship company which had made a “diorama,” or series of life-size
    views, setting forth exactly what traveling by their line would be.
    And instead of being satisfied with inferior work, they had selected
    a skilled artist to paint their pictures.
  </p>

  <p>
    One will serve as a specimen. It was a painting that represented the
    last moments before sailing from Havre to New York. The spectator
    saw before him the long dock crowded with the passengers. Here an
    old mother was tearfully bidding her son good-by; here a party of
    jolly tourists were waving handkerchiefs to friends upon the steamer.
    In another spot was a lonely traveler who seemed to have no friend
    other than a carpet-bag. And, in short, the whole scene was vividly
    rendered with artistic power and with feeling. There were eight of
    these pictures, and the boys left none unvisited.
  </p>

  <p>
    From a little beyond this point the boys could see the full-sized
    section of an ocean-steamer that reached from the floor to the roof,
    that is, counting the smokestack; and the boys agreed to sample that
    section before leaving. As yet, they found it hard to get through
    the galleries. Just as they had made up their minds to go down the
    stairs, they would come upon something that must be looked at. Such
    was a Netherland fishing-boat, so quaint that Philip succeeded in
    photographing it, even though the light was anything but favorable.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">214</span></p>

  <p>Still more fascinating were the German exhibits of men-of-war—little,
    fierce battle-ships with rifled cannon hardly larger than
    darning-needles, but every detail so finely finished that it was like
    watchmakers’ work. In this series were shown all sorts of boats, from
    the swift cruiser down to the tiny torpedo-boat.
  </p>

  <p>
    “What toys men can make when they try!” said Harry, enviously. “To
    think of the clumsy things that are made for children when such
    little beauties as these are possible! Why, there are models of boats
    here in this Fair that are so neat the King of the Fairies would feel
    timid about entering them—and I wish I owned one of them, that’s all!”
  </p>

  <p>
    But there was no time to spare for enthusiasm. Folding-boats must be
    seen, and a gondola,—the last so exquisite in its fittings that the
    ones out on the Lagoon were like it as an ash-cart is like a state
    carriage,—and models of boats from India, whole cases of them, in all
    varieties and endless numbers.
  </p>

  <p>Philip walked away and sat down in a corner.</p>

  <p>“What’s the matter, Philip?” asked Mr. Douglass—“are you tired?”</p>

  <p>
    “I have been tired all the time I’ve been in the Fair,” said Philip;
    “but it isn’t that. I am getting mad. I want to see things; I want to
    learn about them, and remember about them. And there is no chance.
    It’s like trying to pick out stars in the heavens when you don’t know
    a thing about astronomy. As soon as you look at one it disappears,
    and you see another.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Well, Phil,” said Harry, “you know we leave for home to-morrow
    afternoon. Bear up—be brave; it’ll soon be over now. Come and see the
    ferry-boat with the side taken out so you can understand it—if you
    have time. Why, you haven’t begun to see anything yet!”
  </p>

  <p>
    But Mr. Douglass stopped Harry with a warning look; he saw that
    Philip was really getting tired out. Harry took things more easily,
    and was less in earnest; but Philip preferred to see things in
    order, and to study them by system. Excellent as is this rule for
    ordinary cases, a World’s Exposition must be treated differently.
    It is possible, of course, to study only one subject in the Fair,
    and ignore the rest; but no one ever does so. Human nature will not
    permit of it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Descending to the main floor they walked up to the model of the
    Bethlehem steam-hammer that made an arch across the center aisle, and
    after some reflections upon the statistics attached to this monster,
    resolutely passed whole platoons of exhibits no visitor should miss.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mr. Douglass and Harry left Philip to rest awhile upon a settee in
    one of the side corridors, while they went through the section of
    the big Atlantic Liner. Beginning at the steerage, they worked their
    way upward through the office, saloon, smoking-room, and state-rooms
    until from the upper deck they could see Philip’s disconsolate form
    far below.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum">216</span></p>

  <p>
    To Mr. Douglass, who had never crossed the ocean in one of these
    palace steamers, the exhibit was wonderfully interesting; but to
    Harry it was less of a novelty.
  </p>

  <p>
    Returning to where Philip sat, they decided to take lunch before
    going farther, and went into a small space where there was a
    lunch-counter, some very independent waiters, and a slap-dash way
    of serving that added no relish to the rather poor food. But the
    rest was pleasant; and after lunch they felt quite able to enter the
    Annex, where they found another bewildering array of locomotives,
    trains of cars, torpedo-boats, car-seats, rapid-fire guns, and “other
    things too numerous to mention,” as boys say in their compositions
    when they can’t think of anything else.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">THE “DE WITT CLINTON” TRAIN.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    They went through palace cars, and tourist cars, and English
    railway-trains, and then sought relief by examining a military wagon
    so made as to tip up and form a steel-clad breastwork. They could not
    pass this, for a dummy soldier was leveling his rifle directly over
    the edge, and a placard said, “Halt!” in very peremptory letters. It
    repaid them for stopping, for they decided that it was new to all of
    them, and a very ingenious invention.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then leaving the building, they made their way toward home, but were
    caught and held by the great express engine, shown by the New York<span class="pagenum">217</span>
    Central. They had often passed it, but had been reserving a more
    careful examination until they should have seen the exhibits in the
    Transportation Building. Now they walked through the whole train; but
    they found it much like the “Limited Express” they intended to be in
    next day, steaming along toward New York. The “De Witt Clinton,” the
    first locomotive used in New York State, stood in front of “999,” and
    looked like a dwarf kobold beside a splendidly developed giant.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <div class="caption">THE “JOHN BULL” TRAIN.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    They heard some men sneeringly say, “That was the best they could do
    then!” and Harry couldn’t help wondering how long the world would
    have had to wait for “999” if such narrow-minded men were its only
    dependence for improvement.
  </p>

  <p>
    Crossing the broad white road, they next went into the Pennsylvania
    museum of old engines and railroad appliances. Here they spent more
    than an hour studying the curious history of railroad invention from
    the beginning. There was a model of the “John Bull,” and of its
    descendants from children to great-great-great-grandchildren. Nor was
    this display confined to locomotives: there were a packet-boat, such
    as Mr. Douglass remembered to have traveled in when he was a little
    shaver in short trousers and velvet jacket, the still more ancient
    Conestoga wagon with its boat-like<span class="pagenum">218</span> body and long awning, and the old
    stage-coach labeled “Twenty days from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia.”
  </p>

  <div class="figleft">
    <a id="i_231"><img src="images/i_231.jpg" width="350" height="506" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">INTERIOR OF A PULLMAN CAR.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Besides these models there were relics—old tools, old lanterns, and
    ticket-punches; and systems of signaling were also illustrated. But
    it is impossible to recall or put down even the leading attractions
    of this clever little museum.
  </p>

  <p>
    While Mr. Douglass and Harry were looking at these cases, and at the
    photographs showing views along the road, Philip wandered away to the
    other side of the room, and found diagrams, charts, and pieces of
    mechanism for showing the statistics of the Pennsylvania road.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gilded blocks as large and larger than a boy’s head, showed the
    amounts of silver paid to employees every hour. An obelisk built from
    tiny stones represented the amount of ballast in this great railroad
    as compared with the pyramid of Cheops which was constructed on the
    same scale just alongside. The pyramid was nowhere in comparison.
    A little globe with a railroad-track going around the equator and
    lapping enough to tie in a bow-knot showed the length of this
    railroad system. Two bits of rail whereon were silver dollars laid
    edge to edge, were meant to show the cost of the road—a sum large
    enough to cover all its rails with a row of silver dollars. Another
    globe had models of little locomotives running around it, to show the
    number of miles covered by trains—enough to encircle our globe every
    two hours. Tiny coal-carts, drawn by clockwork up from a pretended
    mine, taught that two and one-half tons of coal were burned every
    fifteen seconds.
  </p>

  <p>
    Altogether Philip thought the Pennsylvania had “done herself
    proud”—except in the models of railroad-men in uniform. No one,
    however deeply impressed with the rest of the exhibit, would care to
    ride on a road run by such men as the dummies were. Philip would not
    have been surprised at a<span class="pagenum">219</span> strike on the whole system if the men could
    have seen those great paste-board gawks that stood in their clothes.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the last few days they had been really studying the exhibits
    instead of wandering around with an idea of being amused. As the next
    day was to be their last at the Fair, Mr. Douglass made no objection
    to their going once more to the Plaisance, where there was more fun
    than instruction; and with this prospect in view, they forgave the
    tutor for the useful knowledge they had been so steadily acquiring.

    <div class="caption">A BOY FROM JOHORE.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">The</span> boys had seen a number of unpleasant days at the Fair, but their
    last day was the worst. It did much to reconcile them to going away.
    Not only did it rain in a fine, penetrating drizzle, but the wind
    blew a gale, and kindly carried the dampness where it could not have
    gone by itself. While walking outdoors, the boys saw nothing amusing
    in the weather. But Mr. Douglass, in order to cash a check, had to
    call upon one of the gentlemen whose office was in the Electricity
    Building; and, waiting for him, the boys sat at a window that looked
    out upon the Court of Honor, and then found that the storm had its
    funny side.
  </p>

  <p>
    Visitors seemed to object to walking straight, and leaned over
    against the wind like a fleet of fishing-smacks on a rough day. The
    launches going northward found their propellers only a luxury, for
    their awnings made excellent sails. Hats left their owners’ heads,
    and started to see the Exposition alone. Small boys and men played
    short-stop at a moment’s notice, and became very skilful in “dropping
    upon the” hat as it rolled by upon its brim.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Hats blown off while you wait!” said Harry, laughing as he saw a
    vigorous man spear his own hat with a thrust of his cane. The boys
    counted four similar hunts in a few minutes.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">222</span></p>

  <p>
    Women coming around the corner of the Administration Building seemed
    suddenly impressed with the beauty of the MacMonnies Fountain, and
    started for it at a run; but, quickly changing their minds, beat back
    again to their true course. The flags floated stiff upon the gale,
    and the water in the Lagoon changed color continually.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">THE VENETIAN GLASS-BLOWERS.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    “I feel,” said Mr. Douglass, “that it is rather a pity to spend our
    last few hours here in a visit to the Midway Plaisance. We should
    really prefer to go again to the Art Gallery, which we have not half
    seen.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I know,” said Harry; “but the Art Building is long and time is
    fleeting. The advantage of going to the Midway is that the poor shows
    are not worth staying through, and the good ones are few.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Entering the Midway they found that the rain had dampened the
    enthusiasm of even this crowd—usually the liveliest and gayest
    on the grounds. They passed by the “Congress of Beauty,” and the
    Philadelphia Working-man’s Model Home (Philip wondered why they did
    not show an Idle-man’s Home beside it), and selected the Libbey
    Glass-works for their first visit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within a rounded building they found a tall brick chimney, the lower
    part of which was made into a glass-heating furnace. About this boys
    were carrying upon iron rods lumps of what looked like hot coal. When
    the glass was just right, it was handed to a man, who cut and molded
    and trimmed the lump of glass into a bottle, or goblet, or globe. The
    men were so skilful that it was difficult to make out how they did
    their work;<span class="pagenum">223</span> and, somehow, they never seemed to be making any of the
    more interesting pieces that were exhibited in the show-cases. The
    only bit of skill the boys could discover was that shown in keeping
    the ball of molten glass rounded. Whenever one of the rods was put
    down for a few moments, the glass would become stretched by its own
    weight to a long drop, and then had to be reheated.
  </p>

  <p>
    When one of the workmen wished to cut a finished piece of work from
    the end of the rod, he would hold a pair of cold pincers against it
    for a few moments and it would snap away at a touch.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tickets of admission to this show were announced to be good for
    twenty-five cents applied upon any purchase made in the building.
    But the boys concluded, after an examination of the prices, that
    it was easy to see through <em>that</em> little scheme. In fact, Harry
    declared that if postage-stamps had been on sale there, the price of
    two-centers would have been “two cents and a ticket.”
  </p>

  <div class="figright">
    <a id="i_236"><img src="images/i_236.jpg" width="325" height="351" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">LITTLE DAHOMEY BOY,<br />AND HIS PLAYTHINGS.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    They bought little. Philip paid ten cents “and a ticket” for a
    spun-glass book-mark, and Harry bought a tiny cup of white and ruby
    glass. The compartments about the central hall contained, besides
    show-cases, a loom for weaving glass threads, a glass-cutting wheel,
    and, most interesting of all, a glass-spinning wheel. The boys
    studied this for quite a while. There was a big wheel with a broad,
    thin metal rim kept cool and moist. The workman sat at one side
    holding a glass rod before a blowpipe and moving it round and round
    and slowly forward so as to keep it melted fast enough to feed the
    single long thread to the rapidly revolving wheel.
  </p>

  <p>
    “How do you suppose he begins the spinning?” said Philip, turning to
    Mr. Douglass.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I can only guess,” Mr. Douglass replied; “but I suppose he heats a
    glass rod in the middle, drawing the two ends apart until he makes a
    thread, and then attaches an end of that thread to the wheel, turning
    it slowly at first.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I should think it would be hard to feed the wheel just fast enough,”
    said Harry; “but the man seems to take it easy”; and he did, for he
    was laughing and winking at the crowd.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">AN ACTOR IN THE CHINESE THEATER.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The Venetian Glass-works were just opposite, and as the charge was
    only ten cents, the party went there also. The process was much
    the same; but the men were foreigners, and therefore seemed more
    picturesque. Their work was more interesting to watch. One man was
    making a sort of spray of glass, and affixed leaves, pressed them
    with molding-pincers, and twisted them so quickly that it needed
    close watching for the boys to comprehend the work. He cut the
    softened glass into scallops with scissors as easily as if it had
    been dough—every now and then reheating the bit of work. The boys
    were amused to see him fasten on several ornamental medallions—for he
    used lumps of red-hot glass for glue.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the rooms where the Venetian glass was on sale, there was no
    trace of the businesslike sharpness so noticeable in the American
    establishment over the way. Here the salesmen moved around as slowly
    as their own gondolas in contrast with the electric-launch movements
    of the American shop-people. Leaving the glass-works, they were
    attracted by a “Japanese<span class="pagenum">225</span>
    Bazaar,” and walked through what proved to be only a magnified
    Japanese store, such as they had often seen. But as they went out,
    they saw a small boy who was delighted to have found a great cloth
    fish upon the little lawn outside. With a joyful cheer, he tried to
    raise it up so that the wind would fill it. But another and very
    fierce small boy yelled out, “Here, you!—let that fish alone!” and
    the first boy’s cheering stopped at once.

  <p>
    Upon the same side was the Javanese village, to which they now made
    a second visit; but it was swept by gusts of cold wind and rain,
    and bore little resemblance to the sunny, bright little settlement
    they remembered. The band was silent, there was no chiming of gongs,
    and the merry little Javanese were soaked and sad. The bazaars, or
    shop-counters, were deserted except by those on duty, and they were
    huddled together trying to cheer one another by feeble old Javanese
    jokes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Upon the veranda of one of the houses, the boys saw a family of
    natives at dinner, and one little boy put his hand into the dishes
    and helped himself. He was not reproved, however, by his father or
    mother, for they were doing the same thing.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Here,” said Harry, as they passed the middle of the grounds, “is
    something that only sings louder when it rains”; and he pointed to
    the musical waterwheel that has been already described; but this
    time they noticed there was an idol near by—a queer, grotesque figure
    with which no self-respecting scarecrow would care to claim an
    acquaintance. He looked as if a hairbrush would have been a shock to
    his nerves. Only one more thing needs mention.
  </p>

  <p>
    “There goes <em>five</em>,” said Philip, and Harry caught sight of a
    Javanese boy chasing his fleeing straw hat across the road.
  </p>

  <p>
    Having been advised to see the German village, they took that next,
    and found it well worth a visit. It contained specimens of old German
    houses—for instance, a “Black Forest House” dated 1480. The boys and
    Mr. Douglass walked into its main room, and were becoming a little
    sentimental<span class="pagenum">226</span> over the antique furniture, pictures, and carvings, when
    a voice brought them back four hundred years by inquiring: “Vill the
    shentlemans come see my soufenirs? Here are some fine soufenirs!”
    They declined to see souvenirs, and became absorbed instead in a
    towel-rack. The roller upon which the towel hung was supported in
    the hands of a jolly young peasant’s figure, who seemed smilingly to
    hold it forth. Next to this came a Bavarian dwelling, the outside of
    which was all the party cared to see, for they suspected that the
    German village required a longer visit than they had intended to pay.
    And when they had come to the museum, built in the form of a German
    castle, they were glad they had not stopped to see the Bavarian and
    other model houses.

  </div>

  <p>
    The collection in the museum began with suits of armor from the
    rudest of chain-armor to the ornamented plate of later centuries.
    Arranged upon the wall were specimens of old arms—halberds, pikes,
    hooks, maces, lances, swords, daggers—every sort of iron tool which
    would serve to mince one’s fellow-man. Besides the array upon the
    wall, there were show-cases also containing weapons, as well as
    knives, forks, spoons, and tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    Philip was amazed to see how much the tools of the Middle Ages
    resembled those of to-day. What difference there was, told in favor
    of the old-time workmen, as they seemed to care far more how their
    instruments looked, decorating the handles and putting ornamental
    flourishes on the metal parts. The scissors, forks, and knives also
    were carved and inlaid with gold or silver. Harry saw one enormous
    pocket-knife that he would<span class="pagenum">227</span> have liked to smuggle out. The handle
    was some six inches long, and the knife had four blades—one plain,
    one a saw, one a chopper, and the last a pruning-hook. Probably it
    had been a Christmas present to the head gardener of some Serene
    High Mightiness, given in recompense for having rescued one of Their
    Little High Mightinesses from the horse-pond.
  </p>

  <p>
    The last room in the German castle was filled with dummy figures
    dressed in various historic German costumes. They were grouped as if
    attending a reception, and faced a great figure typifying “Germania”
    surrounded by warriors in helmets and armor.

  <p>
    Harry said he wondered that “no one had thought of calling the
    World’s Fair City, ‘A City of Dummies,’” for all the nations of
    the earth had gone into doll-making to furnish it with a resident
    population—a quiet, orderly, law-abiding race, though not full of
    intelligence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just across from the German village, an enormous placard claimed for
    a Panorama of the Alps the distinction of the “only medal awarded
    for an exhibit on the Plaisance.” It is needless to say that this
    captured our visitors. They went in and began the ascent of an
    inclined passage. It curved spirally round and round until they
    heartily wished it wouldn’t. But<span class="pagenum">228</span> a party just ahead of them cried
    out, “Here we are!” and soon they emerged upon a high platform in the
    middle of the great Swiss Mountains. Harry said he recognized the
    Matterhorn, the Clatterhorn, the Spatterhorn, and the Flatterhorn;
    but the lecturer gave other names than these. The lecturer, with
    frequent allusions to “when I was there,” and one condescending
    “doubtless some of you have <em>heard</em> of Interlaken,” conducted a
    sheep-like crowd of sight-seers along a spiral iron fence that was
    meant to keep people from escaping till they had been at least twice
    around.
  </p>

  <div class="figleft">
    <a id="i_241"><img src="images/i_241.jpg" width="500" height="296" alt="" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>
    Harry, who was not fond of fences as a rule, took in the situation at
    a glance, and solved the difficulty by sneaking under the rails to
    the exit. Philip went after, and Mr. Douglass saw nothing to do but
    to follow suit. But although they did not care much for the lecturer,
    the panorama was a fine piece of painting, and Harry said that “if
    not the Alps it was at least a very good alp for a quarter, even with
    the lecturer thrown in—still better if he had been thrown out!” But
    Harry was unfair to this worthy man: most of the visitors enjoyed his
    clear explanations of the painting, and walked at his heels around
    all the spirals.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Samoa”—the South Sea Island show—consisted of a theater and grounds.
    The grounds were what Philip called “muddish” (a new word to Mr.
    Douglass, but one he could not disapprove), and the boys stopped only
    long enough to buy two bark hats,—pointed nightcaps, very elastic and
    a beautiful brown in color,—and to look in at a Samoan house where,
    according to the sign, “the boy, for a trifling fee, will show how
    to kindle a fire by rubbing two sticks together.” But the boy sat
    huddled in a corner, looking as sour as a lemon, and they left him to
    dream of his native land.
  </p>

  <p>
    Besides, there was a stamping and a pounding and a yelling going on
    in the theater that no healthy American boy could long keep away
    from. When Harry was at the Plaisance one afternoon he had met the
    manager of this show, and that gentleman had given him passes for
    the two cousins;<span class="pagenum">229</span>
    so in they went, to find a little stage whereon
    a gang of savages, naked to the waist, were trying to give people
    their money’s worth so far as stamping, yelling, and racket would
    avail. They had not even “kept their shirts on,” but were all in
    chocolate-tinted negligé. When the curtain (painted with a Moorish
    landscape) hid the row, there was only a short intermission before
    the stage-manager hung out a sign-board announcing a “Religious
    Dance.”
  </p>

    <div class="caption">THE ALGERIAN THEATER.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    After that act was stilled, Harry said: “I didn’t know shinny was a
    religious dance, but I think now it must be. Perhaps among some of
    the Pacific Islands a foot-ball scrimmage would be considered a kind
    of prayer.” The dance really was clever, consisting of wheeling about
    and clattering long and short sticks together rhythmically. The next
    act was some guttural singing by several women and all the men, who
    sat in rows cross-legged along the stage. It was just like the song
    “Swee-ee-eepo—sweepo-o-o! Sweep-ee-o—sweep-o!” that may be heard from
    certain dusky residents of Manhattan Island on the Atlantic coast.
    A Fiji war-dance came next, and consisted in showing how bravely
    they would jab an advancing enemy with a paddle provided he would
    not go and spoil the little game by warding off or hitting back. It
    was grand, and the boys were especially delighted to see one of the
    younger girls come in at the back of the stage and go through the
    whole dance. “She’s a regular Tomboy Fiji,” said Philip.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was more to the program, but the boys tired of it, and betook
    themselves to one of the Irish villages.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here were souvenirs of peat, of bog-oak, of lace, all sorts; all sold
    by tidy little Irish girls with a brogue that it was hard to resist.
    Mr. Douglass picked up a black bog-oak cane. He seldom carried a
    cane, and had little idea of buying it. But the Irish girl looked at
    him with so cordial a smile that he felt bound to say something.
  </p>

  <p>“How much is it?” he asked.</p>

  <p>
    “’Tis a dollar and a half, sir,” she answered in a tone of heartfelt
    regret. Then confidentially, “But it is a fi-i-ine cane, that is,
    sir!”
  </p>

  <p>
    He bought it, and the boys grinned. They had seen that the “blarney
    stone” was at the Fair, and were on their guard. Nevertheless they
    each bought a tiny black pig cut out of the same bog-oak, and were,
    as a matter of course, blarneyed in turn.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">230</span></p>

  <p>
    “How different the people in here!” said Mr. Douglass. “Did you
    notice that there was a row at the gate, and nothing but joking
    within?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Yes; it reminded me of New York at once,” said Harry; “just as Irish
    Day did.”
  </p>

  <p>
    It was now time for them to leave the grounds; and although they
    were glad to get home and rest from sight-seeing, they felt very
    sentimental about taking their last look. They stood in the Court
    of Honor gazing silently about them, feeling as one feels in giving
    a parting hand-shake to a loved friend; and then they turned away,
    knowing that the beautiful dream they had seen and lived in was no
    more than a dream: that the day would come when all that beauty would
    be a memory, and the “Ghost City” only a legend.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the phantom city has taught the American nation that they are
    a great people, who will some day make true in marble all that was
    imagined in that short-lived fairy-story of staff.

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">They</span> packed up that same afternoon, after considerable trouble in
    finding room for the knickknacks they had picked out, and took a
    carriage to the station. They found no signs to direct them, and had
    to inquire several times to make sure which was the track upon which
    they might expect the train for New York. When they thought they were
    certain of this, they saw a train come in on schedule time and on the
    proper track. But, to their surprise, a man called out, “Illinois
    Central train for Cairo and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis!” which threw the crowd into
    an uncertainty anything but pleasant. Missing a local suburban train
    is troublesome enough; but missing a train that is going one third
    across a continent is a disaster.
  </p>

  <p>
    To their great relief, the obliging colored porters very promptly
    corrected the stupid error, and they found themselves safely upon the
    train for New York.
  </p>

  <p>
    Their journey was a repetition of their trip out, except that this
    time they stopped to see the Falls of Niagara, viewing them, as young
    Phinney had done, from above the falls.
  </p>

  <p>
    “It’s a pity to see them from a distance only,” said Mr. Douglass. “I
    should like to stay awhile.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “They are well worth going over carefully,” said Harry, thoughtfully;
    and Philip looked at him inquiringly.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the second day on the train, Mr. Douglass was talking to the
    boys as to their experiences at the Fair; and then Philip’s little
    adventure, before referred to, came out. As he told the story it ran
    something like this:
  </p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">That</span> day when I was taking photographs in the Plaisance, I went
    into the Cairo Street a second time. I wanted, if possible, to get
    a picture of the<span class="pagenum">232</span>
    little boy who leads the camels. They stopped me
    at the door, and while explaining that I had been permitted to take
    photographs there, I put my camera for a few moments on a camp-chair.
  </p>

  <div class="figleft">
    <a id="i_245"><img src="images/i_245.jpg" width="350" height="388" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">A KODAKER CAUGHT.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    When I looked around for it, my camera was missing. I tell you, I
    felt pretty mean. At first I didn’t know what to do. I asked the
    ticket-taker about it, but he hadn’t seen any one take it. Then I
    thought, quick, what a man would do who had picked up a camera like
    that, and I made up my mind that he would want to get out of Cairo
    Street as fast as he could. Of course, most of the people there
    were sight-seeing, and just moved along slowly. So I hopped up on
    top of the camp-chair, and looked over the crowd. Luckily, I caught
    sight of a man with a brown felt hat, who was moving fast through
    the slow-moving people. I made up my mind that it was my last chance
    for my kodak, and I went through the crowd like a snowplow through a
    drift. I kept my eye on that brown felt hat, and pretty soon I caught
    up to the man. Once I thought I had lost him, for a camel came by,
    and I had to get out of the way; but I found him again, and, as I
    said, I got near to him.
  </p>

  <p>
    I saw at once that he had a camera in his hand, and I was pretty sure
    it was mine. But just as I was going to catch hold of it, I happened
    to think it was a serious matter to tell a man he was a thief, and I
    stopped to make sure what I ought to do. The man was pushing through
    the crowd so fast that I had no good chance to take a real square
    look at the camera, so I concluded I would just keep after him till
    he thought he was clear away. He kept looking behind him at first,
    but now he began to go slower, as if he thought everything was all
    right. [“Little dreaming,” Harry put in, “that a sleuth-hound wearing
    magnifying-glasses was upon his tr-rail!”]
  </p>

  <p>
    I kept off to his left, and he didn’t see me. Pretty soon he came out
    into the Fair Grounds, and there weren’t so many people there. He
    turned toward one of the north entrances, and I kept a sharp lookout
    for a Columbian Guard. I didn’t take the first one I saw, because he
    looked sleepy and<span class="pagenum">233</span>
    stupid, and I was afraid he would arrest <em>me</em>; but
    the next was a soldierly-looking fellow, and after seeing my man was
    taking it easy, I went to this guard and said:
  </p>

  <p>
    “That man with the brown felt hat, there, picked up my camera when I
    wasn’t looking, and walked off with it. I want you to get it back for
    me.”
  </p>

  <p>“Sure, young fellow?” he said, looking at me hard.</p>

  <p>
    “Sure,” I said; for by that time I had seen a bruise on one corner of
    the camera where I dropped it once.
  </p>

  <p>
    “All right,” said he. “Come along. You go after the man, and don’t
    lose sight of him, and I’ll go around this little building and meet
    him.”
  </p>

  <p>
    So we did. And it worked first-rate. The guard was a fly sort of a
    fellow, and instead of asking the man whether that was his camera, he
    asked him whether he had a permit for it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The man stopped and looked puzzled for a minute, then he put on a
    face as bold as brass, and said: “No, sir. I have not yet obtained
    one, but I was going to get one.”
  </p>

  <p>“Where were you going for it?” said the guard, to catch him.</p>

    <div class="caption">REGISTERING IN NEW<br />YORK STATE BUILDING.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    “I was about to ask you,” said the man, with a sharp kind of a smile,
    seeing the guard’s little game. This made the guard lose his temper,
    and out he came with the whole story.
  </p>

  <p>
    “This young man here says that camera is his, and that you picked it
    up,” said the guard.
  </p>

  <p>
    “The impertinent young rascal!” said the man, who must have been a
    cool hand.
  </p>

  <p>
    “We’ll see about that,” said the guard, who began to wonder which of
    us was lying.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I don’t propose to be bothered by this young scamp,” said the man,
    seeing that the guard hesitated a little. “If you will tell me where
    to obtain a permit for my camera, I shall be obliged to you.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, his coolness staggered the guard, and it did me. I wondered
    for a minute whether I had made a mistake; but when I looked at the
    camera, there was the bump on the corner, and I was sure again.
  </p>

  <p>“Ask him,” I said to the guard, “what is the name of his camera.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">234</span></p>

  <p>
    “You saucy young villain, I don’t propose to be questioned about
    this any longer!” said the man, and he turned to walk away. But that
    decided the guard.
  </p>

  <p>
    “No, sir!” he said. “You’ll come with me, and we’ll have this
    question settled.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The man looked around quick, as if he was wondering what the chances
    were if he should run for it; but the guard laid his hand on the
    man’s shoulder, and the swindler then decided to brazen it out.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Very good,” he said, looking at his watch; “I shall lose my train,
    but I suppose this absurd matter must be disposed of.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “But I thought you wanted a permit for your camera?” said the guard,
    with a grin; and then the man bit his lip. That time <em>he</em> made a
    mistake.
  </p>

  <p>
    The guard went to a sort of little sentry-box, and sent out a signal.
    Pretty soon a patrol-wagon came driving up, and we were taken in it
    outside of the grounds to a police-station.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Officer,” said the man to the sergeant (I suppose it was), “this
    foolish boy has laid claim to my camera, and—”
  </p>

  <div class="figleft">
    <a id="i_247"><img src="images/i_247.jpg" width="325" height="373" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">ALONG THE LAKE.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    “Now, don’t be in a hurry,” said the officer, coolly. “I’ll hear
    the guard first, please.” The guard told the story very clearly and
    plainly.
  </p>

  <p>“Is that correct?” said the sergeant to me.</p>

  <p>“Yes, sir; and I can prove—” I began.</p>

  <p>
    “Go slow, young man,” said the sergeant, motioning to me to stop
    talking. Then he said to the man who had my camera:
  </p>

  <p>“Is that story correct?”</p>

  <p>“Entirely, Sergeant.”</p>

  <p>
    “Very good,” the sergeant said. “Now, young man, how can you prove it
    is your box?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Well,” said I, “it’s a Kodak No. 4, and it has a bruise on one
    corner.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Yes,” said the swindler, “I see. That is what has caused the
    trouble. Mine has a bruise on the corner, too. I dropped it this
    morning as I was coming through the turnstile.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “That’s rather slim proof to arrest a man on,” said the sergeant,
    <span class="pagenum">235</span>
    looking hard at me. Then I began wondering how I could prove my
    ownership, and I thought of the pictures I had taken.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I know!” I said. “I can prove it by the photographs I took. I
    remember some of them anyway. There was one of—”
  </p>

  <div class="figright">
    <a id="i_248"><img src="images/i_248.jpg" width="325" height="346" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">THE DARK ROOM.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    “Hold on!—hold on!” cried the sergeant, quick as lightning. “It’s the
    defendant’s turn now. Perhaps, sir, you will tell us what pictures
    are in the camera?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I am sorry to say that I cannot,” said the man, still polite. He was
    a smart fellow. “Indeed, the camera belongs to a friend of mine, and
    he lent it to me this morning for the day. He may have taken pictures
    with it. I took only one myself, and that was a view of the crowd in
    Cairo Street. If you will have the pictures developed, you will see
    that I am right.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Then I was scared. I wish you could have seen the fellow—he was as
    cool as a cucumber. He was no common swindler, I’m sure.
  </p>

  <p>
    “That’s a fair proposal,” said the sergeant, who was puzzled by this
    queer case. “Let us adjourn to a photographer. And don’t let either
    of these men get away,” he added, turning to a policeman.
  </p>

  <p>
    So then we formed in procession, and went around the corner to a
    photographer’s and into his dark-room. The sergeant explained what we
    wanted.
  </p>

  <p>
    But before the photographer began to develop the film, I spoke up
    and said: “Sergeant, this man probably took one picture just after
    he picked up the camera. It was all set, and all he had to do was to
    touch the button. Now, it isn’t likely he knows anything about the
    camera if he stole it. If he didn’t, his friend must have told him
    how to work it.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I think that’s a sound argument,” said the sergeant. “But suppose
    you write down all the pictures you remember taking.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I don’t know how to manage the camera entirely,” said the man; “but
    I intended to get the photographer to explain it to me.”
  </p>

  <p>
    While I was writing down all the pictures I remembered, and the
    photographer was developing the film, the sergeant turned to the man
    who had<span class="pagenum">236</span> taken my camera, and said quickly: “By the way, what was the
    name and address of the friend who lent you the camera?”
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, that staggered the fellow completely. “I brought it from New
    York,” he began, “and his name is—”
  </p>

  <div class="figleft">
    <a id="i_249"><img src="images/i_249.jpg" width="325" height="265" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">LUNCHING OUTDOORS.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    “Don’t trouble yourself to invent a name,” said the sergeant,
    sharply. “You said he lent it to you this morning for the day. Now,
    I doubt whether you came from New York this morning. Don’t you think
    that you <em>may</em> have picked up this camera by mistake for the one your
    friend lent to you this morning in New York?”
  </p>

  <p>
    But before the fellow could answer, the photographer said: “The
    pictures tally with the young man’s list, and the one of the crowd in
    Cairo Street is a double exposure showing that the film hadn’t been
    wound up after this young man had taken the previous picture outside.
  </p>

  <p>
    “And, Sergeant, the funniest part of it all is, that one of the
    pictures that the young man took just at the door of Cairo Street,
    shows this man standing looking at the camera, but without any of
    his own!” and then all the men in the room looked at the thief and
    grinned.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Well,” said the sergeant to the man, “what do you think about that
    mistake?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I’m afraid it must have been an error,” said the man, rather
    shakily. “I picked up this camera thinking it was my own, and—”
  </p>

  <p>
    The sergeant said sharply, “Now, you get out of here, and quick
    too. It wouldn’t pay to prosecute you, for you’re too slippery. Get
    out—quick!” And the man just skipped.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Now, young man,” said the sergeant, “you take better care of your
    camera next time. I’ll see you into the grounds again.”
  </p>

  <p>
    So I thanked him. He saw me through the gate, and that was the end of
    my adventure. But it was a close shave. I didn’t tell you about it
    before, for fear you would think I had been stupid.

    </h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    “<span class="smcap">No</span>, sir; not this afternoon, sir. I’m very sorry, but that’s the
    orders. We have to be very careful with her, sir. There hasn’t been
    anybody in it for full two hours,” said the man at the gate.
  </p>

  <p>
    “But it’s one of the advertised attractions of the Midway, and I
    insist,” said Mr. Douglass. He had already been in the Ferris Wheel
    once before, and had not meant to return to it, but circumstances
    were too strong for him, and here he was, ready to pay, but unable to
    get a ticket.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Insist or not,” said the man at the gate; “you can’t get in if you
    want to; we can’t let you in if we want to. The wheel is sulky, and
    has been turning slow and ugly like that since noon to-day.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “But I leave the city to-night,” said the tutor, “and I will not
    leave without another ride in the great wheel.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Very good,” said the man, turning on his heel; “get in if you can.
    The machinery is out of order, and we can’t stop the wheel—maybe you
    can”; and he walked off whistling “Comrades.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The man’s indifference roused Mr. Douglass. “We’ll see,” said he,
    “whether I won’t have one more ride on the Ferris Wheel!”
  </p>

  <p>
    After a brief glance around him, his eye caught the sign of the
    Bedouin encampment. Rushing toward it, he threw a twenty-dollar gold
    piece upon the counter, told the attendant to keep the change, and
    was soon in earnest conference with the Arab sheiks.
  </p>

  <p>
    He gave each a golden double eagle, and they bowed low. “Allah be
    praised, the white chief’s will shall be done!” they exclaimed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then, without losing a moment, the three hurried to the great Ferris
    Wheel, which still went painfully, jerkily about, with a low growl
    that boded<span class="pagenum">240</span> mischief. But if the wheel was out of temper, so was
    Mr. Douglass; and, saying “Ready!” to the Arabs, he placed himself
    between them, one grasping each of his arms. “Let go!” the tutor
    called; and at the word, the sinewy Arabs raised him from the ground,
    and, after one or two preliminary swings, hurled him through the air
    as if he had been a stone from a sling.

  <p>
    Crash! went the tutor through the glass, just scraping his way
    between two of the iron bars, but landing safely in a car.
  </p>

  <p>“There!” he cried, “I <em>shall</em> have another ride in the wheel!”</p>

  <p>
    Up it went, over, down, and he came slowly toward where the Arabs
    stood in earnest talk. As he approached, one stepped forward:
  </p>

  <p>“Give more bakshish!” he cried, “or—”</p>

  <p>
    Mr. Douglass shook his head. The Arabs shook their fists. He laughed
    at them. Then, raging with fury, one turned and said in Arabic to the
    other:
  </p>

  <p>“Seeme letim sleyd!”</p>

  <p>
    No sooner said than done. Each Bedouin seized one of the gigantic
    supports that upheld the wheel, and pulled with all his might. They
    were both well-developed and had a strong pull. With a long pull and
    a strong pull and a pull all together, they sprung out the supports,
    the great wheel<span class="pagenum">241</span> fell from its place, and the Bedouins, seeing the
    mischief they had done—and perhaps repenting of it, for they were
    only hasty, not wicked—leaped upon their priceless donkeys, and were
    soon lost in the suburbs of Chicago. Unlike the cat, they did not
    return, and have nothing more to do with the story. But no doubt they
    often regretted, as they grew older, the hasty outburst of temper
    that was now to do so much mischief.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the wheel, with Mr. Douglass an unwilling passenger, dropped to
    the ground, and rolled slowly up the Plaisance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Its first victim was the Turkish village, and when the wheel had
    passed, the village looked like a flat, hand-colored map.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <div class="caption">THE FISHERIES BUILDING, FROM ACROSS THE LAGOON.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Mr. Douglass, as soon as he saw what the Arabs were at, had climbed
    out of the car, and, more like a spider than a tutor, made his way
    to the axle, where he stood upright, walking backward upon the axle
    as the wheel ran forward. From this well-chosen perch, he could, and
    did, witness the ensuing scene—which was described by the Chicago
    reporters as “unusual.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The Turkish village, being a trifle lumpy, diverted the wheel but
    little, and the next assault was upon the corner of the Panorama of
    the Alps. The end of the canvas became entangled in the wheel, and
    was stretched from one side to the other, so that subsequently many
    thought that there had been a land-slide when they saw the wheel
    pass.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">242</span></p>

  <p>
    Mr. Hagenbeck’s far-famed Animal Show also came in for a share of
    damage, the wheel crushing one corner of the menagerie, and picking
    up the small performing-bear in such a way that he was compelled to
    leap from car to car as each came upright, and walk the wheel as
    if it were a circus ball. He was rescued unhurt, but considerably
    fatigued, when the wheel finally—but it was not yet through.
  </p>

  <p>
    Glancing to the other side of the Plaisance, the Libbey Glass
    Company was splintered into what one of the Irish dairymaids
    declared to be “smithereens,” and the monster rolled onward to where
    the International Dress and Costume Exhibit was situated. Here it
    broke in one side of the building, and then, catching sight of the
    contents, with a shriek from every cog fled into the Fair Grounds,
    cutting its way through the Illinois Central and Intramural bridges,
    with no more than slight crunches. The bear and Mr. Douglass were
    still walking their tread-mills, and the Panorama of the Alps still
    decorated a whole side of the wheel.
  </p>

  <div class="figleft">

    <div class="caption">AT A DRINKING-FOUNTAIN.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    But the great wheel, though out of temper, was not yet without
    feeling. It swerved aside upon reaching the Woman’s Building, plunged
    into the Lagoon, where, frightened by the squawking of the swans,
    it shot madly toward the Government Building. Probably it would
    have gone entirely through except for the fact that the Department
    of Justice lay directly in its course. It could not face the stern
    portraits of judges upon its walls, and, destroying only the big tree
    and a few other antiquities of slight importance, it encountered the
    Liberal Arts Building but slightly checked in speed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mr. Douglass was tired of his ride, and, from the bear’s growling,
    concluded that his fellow-passenger was also ready to stop.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I wish,” said Mr. Douglass (never relaxing his backward walk), “that
    I had omitted this last visit to the Fair. It is rather exciting, but
    too wearisome after my long weeks of tramping. I am glad to see the
    Building of Manufactures ahead. The wheel may get through it, though
    I couldn’t; but it won’t go much farther.”
  </p>

  <p>
    But he was wrong. The lath and plaster offered little resistance to
    the iron wheel, and the little elevator boy in the center of the
    building opened<span class="pagenum">243</span> all the throttles, shot bodily out through the roof,
    elevator and all, and landed in the Viking ship, much put out but
    little hurt.
  </p>

  <div class="figright">
    <a id="i_256"><img src="images/i_256.jpg" width="325" height="368" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">A LITTLE VISITOR</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    On its way down the center aisle, the wheel picked up the big
    telescope, and on its next revolution flung that marvelous instrument
    high in air. But Ben Franklin was waiting for just such a chance, and
    he promptly accepted it. Chucking aside his key and kite-line, he
    stepped lightly out from the portico of the Electricity Building and
    caught the telescope on the fly (for which feat he afterward received
    a vote of thanks from the University of Chicago), placed it carefully
    on the Wooded Island, and modestly resumed his place on the pedestal,
    saying simply, “A penny saved is two pence clear.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Cutting a clear channel through the biggest building, the wheel
    leaped the Basin—a sight that so astonished Miss Progress that she
    called to the Sciences and Arts to save themselves, came down from
    her perch, fled shrieking into Machinery Hall, and took the Crane for
    the other end.
  </p>

  <p>
    Miss Republic noticed the passing of the wheel, but, until it was
    gone, did not understand what was going on.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wheel was now headed directly for Agricultural Hall, but as
    it came within a threatening distance, the three young women of
    the Zodiac family, with a single impulse, threw their globe at the
    wheel—at the same time uttering three shrieks that did more execution
    than the ball they had thrown. The ball shattered one of the towers
    on the Convent; but the shrieks saved the Agricultural Building, with
    all its priceless corn-cobs, preserved prunes, and patent harvesters.
  </p>

  <p>
    Scared from its course, the wheel sought an avenue of escape. To
    Mr. Douglass’s horror, and the bear’s regret, its course lay toward
    the Moving Sidewalk. Striking the wrong (the incoming) side, the
    wheel began to see that it had made a mistake, for gradually it was
    compelled to slow up.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mr. Douglass and the performing-bear seized the opportunity to take a
    short rest. Both were experienced travelers, and never failed to take
    advantage of any chance to relieve the monotony of a journey.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, an alarm had been sounded upon all the trumpets held by<span class="pagenum">244</span>
    figures upon the Administration Building; telephones were at work
    calling aid; the Fire Queen and all the patrol-wagons were dashing to
    and fro; the Krupp gun was loaded and trained upon the wheel; and all
    was bustle and excitement.
  </p>

  <p>
    Buffalo Bill, Texas Jack, and Professor Hagenbeck with high boots on,
    came riding like mad across the Court of Honor, and charged bravely
    down upon the motionless wheel. When within range, Mr. Cody opened
    fire, and succeeded in breaking all the windows that still remained
    intact in any of the wheel cars. Texas Jack lassoed the bear, and
    dragged the grateful beast from the top of the wheel, whereupon the
    professor consoled the little animal by giving him the usual lump
    of sugar taken from the professor’s coat-tail pocket. Just at this
    moment, Engines “999,” “John Bull,” and “De Witt Clinton” arrived for
    the purpose of hauling the wheel back to its place.
  </p>

  <p>They were just too late.</p>

  <p>
    The wheel having lost headway and remained still for a short time,
    now began to be carried back along the sidewalk. It rounded the
    curve, ran along the pier to the end, and, on coming back, had
    acquired a speed that sent it off upon a new expedition.
  </p>

  <p>
    This time the Statue of the Republic realized there was something
    irregular in the action of the wheel, and aroused from her lethargy
    enough to step languidly ashore and let the wheel go by. The Krupp
    gun was discharged, but the missile, missing the wheel, put an end to
    the battle-ship “Illinois,” who went into plaster chips with her flag
    still flying.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mr. Douglass said, pettishly, “I am getting very much bored at having
    to run about on this axle, and I do think the authorities of the Fair
    ought to do something to protect a visitor from such an accident.”
  </p>

  <p>
    But his conscience told him that he had done wrong in entering the
    wheel without having secured permission.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the great unicycle ran for the Transportation Building, the statue
    of “Land” remarked, “For the land’s sake!” and hastily put on brakes,
    a course for which he was commended by Messrs. Fulton and Watt, his
    neighbors. Stephenson, however, blamed him for not first securing one
    of the air-brakes, of which there were plenty inside the building.
  </p>

  <p>
    Striking the Intramural line, the wheel ran over Festival Hall,
    exploding the bellows of the great organ, and then ran triumphantly
    up and bursted the Horticultural bubble of glass.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just here, however, the wheel and Mr. Douglass caught sight of the
    dome of the Illinois State Building, and the iron creature turned
    aside with a sigh that could be plainly heard at the British Building
    on the lake-shore, and then ran down the Midway like a hunted stag.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">245</span></p>

  <p>
    Here Professor Hagenbeck and his young men received the wheel with
    stern glances that even that awful monster of iron and glass found
    irresistible. With a few lashes of his long whip, the professor soon
    reduced the wheel to submission, and at the word of command it ran
    to its place, climbed into position, and was still. The professor
    immediately gave the wheel a lump of sugar from his coat-tail pocket,
    patted it upon the cogs, and saying, “There will be no further
    trouble, I think,” walked serenely back to lunch.
  </p>

  <p>He had forgotten Mr. Douglass!</p>

  <p>How was the poor tutor to reach the ground?</p>

  <p>
    He tried to climb down one of the spokes, but slipped, lost his hold,
    and was falling, falling, fall—
  </p>

  <p>
    “I really believe, boys,” said Mr. Douglass, “that I’ve been asleep.
    I’ve had a remarkable dream. It was—” But the brakeman called:
  </p>

  <p>“New York, last stop, all out!”</p>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
